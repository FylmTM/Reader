## Development considerations

**General:**

* Single static binary
* Sensible default configuration out-of-the-box
* Keep dependency count as small as possible

**Backend:**

* Strive for 100% integration test coverage on API
* Maintain benchmarks for all critical API endpoints
* Benchmarks must test against sizable data size

**Frontend:**

* Support only latest versions of popular browsers
* Strive for smallest js & css bundle size as possible 
* First-class support for both mobile & desktop layouts
* Dark theme only
