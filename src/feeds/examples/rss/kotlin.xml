				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the keynote at KotlinConf, Andrey highlighted our strategic view on the current areas of focus for the evolution of Kotlin, and our plans for Kotlin 1.4 which will be released some time next year.</p>

<p>Our vision is for Kotlin to be a reliable companion for all your endeavors, a default language choice for your tasks. To accomplish this, we’re going to make it shine on all platforms. Multiple case studies from companies well-known in the industry show that we are making good progress in this direction.</p>
<p>Kotlin 1.4 that is going to arrive in spring 2020 will make another step forward for the Kotlin ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Focusing on quality</h2>
<p>Most of all, Kotlin 1.4 will focus on quality and performance. Kotlin is a modern language that already pioneers many ideas and approaches. We’re going to keep it modern and always evolving. At the moment, however, we believe that Kotlin has reached the stage where improving the overall experience is more important than adding big features. This is why Kotlin 1.4 will deliver only a few small language changes, which are explained in detail <a href="#language-features">below</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7623"></span></p>
<p>We’ve already managed to achieve some impressive results in boosting the performance of IDEs that support Kotlin. The code completion speed has increased substantially compared to previous versions:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7575" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/completion.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/completion1.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/completion.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Together with the Gradle team, we’ve made Gradle scripts faster. Kotlin 1.3.60, Gradle Import in Android Studio is about 2.5 times as fast and takes about 75% less memory than it did in Kotlin 1.3.10:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/Memory2.png" alt="Memory" width="1309" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7631" /></p>
<p>What’s more, loading <code>build.gradle.kts</code> entails almost zero CPU usage! Also, compiling Kotlin/Native in dev mode is becoming up to 2 times as fast with code caching.</p>
<p>We understand that build speed is often the biggest concern for our users, and we are constantly improving our toolchain to address that. But incremental improvements cannot keep up with the natural growth of production codebases: while we make compilation faster, users write more code, and the overall build time doesn’t improve enough. It’s become clear that we need to reimplement the compiler to make it really fast.</p>
<h2>New compiler</h2>
<p>The goal for the new compiler implementation is to be really fast, unify all the platforms Kotlin supports, and provide an API for compiler extensions. This is going to be a multi-year effort, but we started a while ago, so some parts of this new implementation are going to arrive in 1.4, and the transition will be very gradual. It&#8217;s happening already; for instance, if you’ve tried <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/06/kotlin-1-3-40-released/#new-type-inference">the new algorithm for type inference</a>, that’s a part of the new compiler. The approach for other parts will be the same; that is, both versions will be available for some time, the old one and the new one in an experimental mode; and when the new one becomes stable, it will become the default.</p>
<h3>Speed-up with the new front-end</h3>
<p>The bulk of the speed-up we expect from the new compiler will come through a new front-end implementation.</p>
<p>To provide a little background, compilation can be thought of as a pipeline that takes source files and turns them into executable code step by step. The first big step in this pipeline is colloquially referred to as the front-end of the compiler. It parses the code, resolves names, performs type checking, etc. This part of the compiler also works inside the IDE when it highlights errors, navigates to definitions, and searches for symbol usages in your project. And this is the step where <code>kotlinc</code> spends the most time nowadays, so we want to make it much faster.</p>
<p>The current implementation is not complete yet, and it will not arrive in 1.4. However, it already does most of the time-consuming work, and we can measure the expected speed-up. Our benchmarks (compiling YouTrack and the Kotlin compiler itself) show that the new front-end will be about 4.5 times as fast as the existing one.</p>
<h3>Unified back-ends and extensibility</h3>
<p>After the front-end is done analyzing the code, a back-end generates the executables. We have three back-ends: Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/Native. The first two were historically written independently and didn’t share much code. When we started Kotlin/Native, it was based on a new infrastructure built around an internal representation (IR) for Kotlin code which serves a function somewhat similar to bytecode in virtual machines. We are now migrating the other two back-ends to the same IR. As a result, we will share a lot of the back-end logic and have a unified pipeline, to allow most features, optimizations, and bugfixes to be done only once for all targets.</p>
<p>We will gradually migrate to the new back-ends, and in 1.4 they are unlikely to be enabled by default, but users will be able to opt into using them explicitly.</p>
<p>A common back-end infrastructure opens the door for multiplatform compiler extensions. One can plug into the pipeline and add some custom processing and/or transformations which will automatically work for all targets. In 1.4 we do not provide a public API for such extensions (the API will be stabilized later), but we are working closely with our partners, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose">JetPack Compose</a>, who are building their compiler plugins already.</p>
<h3>Meet KLib: Kotlin Library Format</h3>
<p>To build a multiplatform library in Kotlin and ship it so that clients can depend on it, one needs a distribution format that works equally on any platform. This is why we&#8217;re introducing KLib: a library format for Kotlin multiplatform. A KLib file contains serialized IR. Your code may add it as a dependency, and the compiler back-end will pick it up and generate executable code for the given platform. The analogy with bytecode still holds here: one can analyze and transform KLibs much like JVM bytecode. Any transformations done to the serialized IR will affect any platform the KLib will be used for.</p>
<p>In fact, Kotlin/Native has been using the KLibs format to distribute Kotlin native libraries for quite a while, and now we are extending the format to support other back-ends and multiplatform libraries. The format will be experimental in 1.4, and we will work on providing a stable ABI for it in future versions.</p>
<h2>More multiplatform news</h2>
<h3>Running iOS code in Android Studio</h3>
<p>We are working on a plugin for Android Studio that will be able to run, test, and debug Kotlin code on iOS devices and simulators. The plugin is using proprietary code from IntelliJ, so it will be closed-source. It will not bring language support for Objective-C or Swift, and some operations such as deployment to AppStore may require running Xcode, but anything you do with Kotlin code will work from Android Studio with the new plugin installed. We expect to open a preview for this plugin in 2020.</p>
<h3>Kotlin/Native runtime improvements</h3>
<p>Apart from Linux, Windows, macOS, and iOS, Kotlin/Native now works on watchOS and tvOS, so virtually any device can run Kotlin. We are also working on the runtime performance of Kotlin/Native to make iOS Kotlin programs run even faster.</p>
<h3>Core libraries</h3>
<p>The Kotlin core libraries work on all platforms. This includes <code>kotlin-stdlib</code> which handles all the basic types and collections, <code>kotlinx.coroutines</code>, <code>kotlinx.serialization</code>, and <code>kotlinx.io</code>. The support for dates is really needed in the multiplatform world, and this is what we are working on: experimental Durations have been already added to stdlib, and DateTime support is under way.</p>
<p>Another important addition to Kotlin libraries is <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Flow</a> which is a coroutine-based implementation of Reactive Streams. Flow is great at processing streams of data, and it’s making use of the power of Kotlin in doing so. Apart from its ergonomics, Flow brings extra speed. On <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/develop/benchmarks/src/jmh/kotlin/benchmarks/flow/scrabble/README.md">some benchmarks</a> it is almost 2 times as fast as existing popular Reactive Streams implementations.</p>
<h3>For library authors</h3>
<p>As creating new libraries is vital for the Kotlin ecosystem, we keep improving the experience of library authors. The new library authoring mode will help shape your code in the way that’s best for stable APIs. Also, we are going to release Dokka 1.0 to support docs generation for all platforms.</p>
<h3>Multiplatform web</h3>
<p>Sharing code across platforms is great for mobile, but it’s also great for Web clients: a lot can be shared with the server and/or with mobile apps. We invest more and more in the Kotlin/JS tooling, and now can do very fast development roundtrips, from changing Kotlin code to seeing results in the browser:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7575" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/RoundTrip.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/RoundTrip.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/12/RoundTrip.png';" alt="" /></p>
<p>We’ve also improved JS interop so that now you’ll be able to attach an NPM dependency to a Kotlin project and any <code>.d.ts</code> type definitions will be picked up automatically by the Kotlin toolchain.</p>
<p>The new IR-based back-end will also bring significant improvements in binary sizes. Compiled JS files can become half their current size.</p>
<h2 id="language-features">New language features</h2>
<p>Kotlin 1.4 will deliver a few new language features.</p>
<h3>SAM conversions for Kotlin classes</h3>
<p>The community has requested us to introduce support for SAM conversions for Kotlin classes (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-7770">KT-7770</a>). SAM conversion applies if you pass a lambda as an argument when an interface or a class with only one single abstract method is expected as a parameter. Then the compiler automatically converts the lambda to an instance of the class implementing the abstract member function.</p>
<p>SAM conversions currently only work for Java interfaces and abstract classes. The initial idea behind this design was to use function types explicitly for such use-cases. It turned out, however, that function types and typealiases don’t cover all the use-cases, and people often had to keep an interface in Java only to get a SAM-conversion for it.</p>
<p>Unlike Java, Kotlin will not allow a SAM conversion for every interface with one single abstract method. We believe that an intention to make an interface applicable for SAM conversion should be explicit. Thus, to define a SAM interface, you’ll need to mark an interface with the <code>fun</code> keyword to emphasize that it can be used as a functional interface:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun interface Action {
    fun run()
}

fun runAction(a: Action) = a.run()

fun main() {
    runAction {
        println(&quot;Hello, KotlinConf!&quot;)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that passing a lambda instead of a <code>fun interface</code> will be supported only in a new type inference algorithm.</p>
<h3>Mixing named and positional arguments</h3>
<p>Kotlin prohibits mixing arguments with explicit names (“named”) and regular ones without names (“positional”) unless you put named arguments only after all the positional ones. In one case, however, it’s really annoying: when all arguments stay in their correct positions and you want to specify a name for one argument in the middle. Kotlin 1.4 will fix this issue, so you will be able to write code like:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun f(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) {}

fun main() {
    f(1, b = 2, 3)
}
</pre>
<h3>Optimized delegated properties</h3>
<p>We’ll improve the underlying way in which the <code>lazy</code> property and some other delegated properties are compiled.</p>
<p>Generally, a delegated property can access the corresponding <code>KProperty</code> reflection object. For instance, when using <code>Delegates.observable</code>, you can display information about the modified property:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
import kotlin.properties.Delegates

class MyClass {
    var myProp: String by Delegates.observable(&quot;&lt;no name&gt;&quot;) {
        kProperty, oldValue, newValue -&gt;
        println(&quot;${kProperty.name}: $oldValue -&gt; $newValue&quot;)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val user = MyClass()
    user.myProp = &quot;first&quot;
    user.myProp = &quot;second&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>To make this possible, the Kotlin compiler generates an additional syntactic member property, an array storing all <code>KProperty</code> objects that represent delegated properties used inside the class:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
&gt;&gt;&gt; javap MyClass

public final class MyClass {
    static final kotlin.reflect.KProperty[] $$delegatedProperties;
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Some delegated properties, however, don’t use <code>KProperty</code> in any way. For them, generating an object in <code>$$delegatedProperties</code> is suboptimal. The Kotlin 1.4 release will optimize such cases. If the delegated property operators are <code>inline</code>, and the <code>KProperty</code> parameter is not used, the corresponding reflection objects will not be generated.</p>
<p>The most outstanding example is the <code>lazy</code> property. The implementation of <code>getValue</code> for the<code>lazy</code> property is <code>inline</code> and doesn’t use the <code>KProperty</code> parameter:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
inline operator fun &lt;T&gt; Lazy&lt;T&gt;.getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty&lt;*&gt;): T = value
</pre>
<p>Starting with Kotlin 1.4, when you define a <code>lazy</code> property, the corresponding <code>KProperty</code> instance won’t be generated. If the only delegated properties you use in a class are <code>lazy</code> properties (and other properties that comply with this optimization), the whole <code>$$delegatedProperties</code> array won’t be generated for the class:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
class MyOtherClass {
    val lazyProp by lazy { 42 }
}

&gt;&gt;&gt; javap MyOtherClass
public final class MyOtherClass {
    // no longer generated:
    static final kotlin.reflect.KProperty[] $$delegatedProperties; 
    ...
}
</pre>
<h3>Trailing Commas</h3>
<p>This minor syntactic change turns out to be incredibly convenient! You can place an additional trailing comma after the last parameter in a parameter list. You can then swap lines or add new parameters without having to add or remove the missing commas.</p>
<h3>Other notable changes</h3>
<p>A useful <code>typeof</code> function introduced <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/06/kotlin-1-3-40-released/#type-of">in Kotlin 1.3.40</a> is going to become stable and supported on all platforms.</p>
<p>The feature that lets you enable <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> inside <code>when</code> was already described in <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/11/kotlin-1-3-60-released/#break-and-continue">the 1.3.60 release blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>We’re really grateful to everyone who has tried the Kotlin EAPs and experimental features and has given us feedback. We are developing the Kotlin language together with you, and making many design decisions based on your invaluable inputs. Keeping this fast and effective feedback loop going with the community is really important to help Kotlin become the best it can be!</p>
<p>We’re really grateful to all members of our community who are creating so many amazing things with Kotlin. Let’s continue to Kotlin together!</p>
<p>By the way, the Kotlin plugin inside IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio collects anonymized statistics of your usage of its functionality. We want to kindly ask you to opt into these statistics, as they help us understand what works, what is causing difficulties, and what we should focus on improving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to present the new release today, Kotlin 1.3.60. In addition to the quality improvements, this version focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing the comparison of <code>inline</code> classes.</li>
<li>Tooling improvements for debugging, J2K converter, and Gradle scripts written in Kotlin.</li>
<li>Support for more Kotlin/Native platforms/targets.</li>
<li>Improving the Kotlin/MPP IDE experience.</li>
<li>For Kotlin/JS, adding support for source maps and improving the platform test runner integration.</li>
<li>Preview for some already implemented features of Kotlin 1.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the complete list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/1.3.60/ChangeLog.md">change log</a>. As always, we’re really grateful to our <a href="#external-contributions">external contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details!</p>
<h2>Language changes</h2>
<p>An incremental release doesn&#8217;t bring any language changes other than minor improvements (like changing confusing error messages) or updates for experimental features (like <code>inline</code> classes). To take a sneak peek at what is coming in Kotlin 1.4, read the <a href="#upcoming-in-14">corresponding section below</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7440"></span></p>
<h3 id="inline-classes">Improvements for inline classes</h3>
<p>The equality comparison of two instances of <code>inline</code> classes caused unnecessary boxing of their underlying values. Starting with v1.3.60, value comparisons are optimized:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
inline class MyClass(val value: Int) {
  // Generated by the compiler:
  // public static final boolean equals-impl0(int p1, int p2) {
  //   return p1 == p2;
  // }
}
fun main() {
  val first = MyClass(1)
  val second = MyClass(1)
  println(first == second)
  // Called under the hood:
  // MyClass.equals-impl0(first, second)
}
</pre>
<p>In the bytecode, a special static method <code>equals-impl0</code> which compares the underlying values is generated for each <code>inline</code> class. When you use the equality comparison on unboxed instances, it’s called under the hood to avoid extra boxing.</p>
<p>Note that for now, it’s not possible to override <code>equals/hashCode</code> for inline classes. The generated <code>equals-impl0</code> method simply compares the values. In the future versions, when the custom <code>equals</code> for inline classes is supported, the same <code>equals-imp0</code> method is intended to be used under the hood.</p>
<p>Note that for compatibility reasons, this optimization will work for the <code>kotlin.Result</code> class starting with Kotlin 1.4 only.</p>
<h3>Improved error messages</h3>
<p>In rare situations, when you read a compiler error message, it’s not obvious why the error occurs. We try to fix this and to improve any error messages that might cause confusion.</p>
<p>Kotlin supports the trailing lambda convention: the lambda can be moved out of the parentheses. Such a lambda can also begin on the following line. This convention causes confusion sometimes when the compiler assumes that the curly braces on the next line should be the lambda argument of the function, but they&#8217;re not:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7441" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/danglingLambdas1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/danglingLambdas1.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/danglingLambdas1.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Now the error message for such cases has been improved, and you can automatically apply an easy fix: insert a semicolon at the end of the preceding line. (Yes, a semicolon is sometimes necessary in Kotlin!)</p>
<p>Another case worth highlighting is trying to make a mutable variable lazy. A <code>lazy</code> variable is by design read-only, but this might cause confusion. Now the error message is improved and an automatic quick-fix is available:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7442" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/diagnosticsLazy.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/diagnosticsLazy1.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/diagnosticsLazy.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>If you have other use-cases in mind that seem confusing or if you&#8217;re missing some useful quick-fixes, please log such requests in our <a href="http://kotl.in/issue">issue tracker</a>.</p>
<h2>IntelliJ IDEA support</h2>
<h3>Scratches and Worksheets</h3>
<p>We’ve redesigned and improved <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/quick-run.html">Scratch files</a>, which let you perform small experiments with your codebase. Now it&#8217;s easier to see the results, which are shown in a different window. The multiline output is wrapped, and the output for the given line is highlighted:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7575" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/Scratches.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/Scratches.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/Scratches.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, scratch files don’t play well. There are situations where you would prefer to use a sandbox that&#8217;s part of the project, rather than to be defined outside of the project. This can be especially useful for educational purposes, creating demo projects, or during presentations. For all such use-cases, please welcome the brand new Kotlin Worksheets:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7578" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/worksheets.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/worksheets.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/worksheets.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Kotlin Worksheets are conceptually and technically very similar to Scratch files: you can play with your codebase and see the results right away. The major difference between the two is that Worksheets are a part of the project, which means they can be stored in a VCS and shared, while Scratches are intended to be used outside of a project.</p>
<h3>build.gradle.kts</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re working on enhancing your user experience with Kotlin Gradle build scripts. We already have completion and highlighting performance improvements, and we will continue working closely with Gradle to improve it further.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7446" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/gradleKts.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/gradleKts.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/gradleKts.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<h3>Debugging improvements</h3>
<p>You can now set <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-breakpoints.html#method_breakpoint">function breakpoints</a> in the Kotlin code. The debugger will then stop execution on entering or exiting the corresponding function. You can also set an additional entry condition if needed:</p>

onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/functionBreakpoints.png';" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<h3>Completion and imports improvements</h3>
<p>Several known bugs have been fixed, like completion for cases when the package name matches the local variable name:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7471" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/packageNames1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/packageNames.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/packageNames1.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Now if you define a typealias for enum, its members are now correctly shown in completion:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7474" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/completionEnums1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/completionEnums1.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/completionEnums1.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>If you use an operator function like <code>invoke</code> via the concise operator syntax, IntelliJ IDEA will suggest importing it automatically:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7474" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/operatorImport1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/operatorImport.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/operatorImport1.png';" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<h3>New Java-to-Kotlin converter</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve done some good work on the new Java-to-Kotlin converter. Many corner-case issues have been fixed, such as conversion for static imports and proper analysis of usages of a collection, should a collection become mutable or read-only after the conversion, even if this collection itself is a generic argument.</p>
<p>Now, when you convert several files at once, they are analyzed together and the usages from the other files affect the final result. For example, if you pass <code>null</code> as a <code>String</code> argument to a <code>foo</code> function in Java, after converting a function and its usage together, the converted Kotlin function will take a nullable <code>String?</code> as an argument:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7442" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/j2k1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/j2k.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/11/j2k1.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Note that the new converter is now used by default.</p>
<h2>Eclipse IDE plugin update</h2>
<p>We are happy to announce that the kotlin-eclipse plugin now supports experimentally incremental compilation for single modules. To try it, select the &#8220;incremental compilation&#8221; checkbox in the <code>Kotlin | Building</code> section of Eclipse properties. It&#8217;s still an experimental feature, so we will be happy to hear any feedback you may have!</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/EclipseScreenshot.png" alt="EclipseScreenshot" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7580" /></p>
<h2>Kotlin/Multiplatform</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve devoted a lot of focus to MPP tooling, so if anything didn’t quite work the way you expected in the past, please give it another try!</p>
<p>While future release(s) may bring new <em>superpowers</em> to the multiplatform side of Kotlin, this one comes with a <strong>lot</strong> of improvements/fixes to the usability within the IDE. In particular, we&#8217;ve significantly enhanced some &#8220;create <code>expect</code>&#8221; quick-fixes.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native</h2>
<p>The Kotlin/Native compiler has acquired a few new capabilities:</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generic Kotlin/Multiplatform command-line parser</h3>
<p>Some of you may have noticed that the <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.cli"><code>kotlinx.cli</code></a> project has been dormant for a few months. We’re happy to share that the project&#8217;s code has been (mostly) rewritten, and it&#8217;s also included in this release of the Kotlin/Native compiler.</p>
<p>We appreciate feedback from early adopters! You can check out how it’s used in some samples (<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/3b81f1202050167d803abf300642262a3d6c5e14/samples/tetris/src/tetrisMain/kotlin/main.kt#L10">tetris game</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/3b81f1202050167d803abf300642262a3d6c5e14/samples/csvparser/src/csvParserMain/kotlin/CsvParser.kt#L33">CSV parser</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/3b81f1202050167d803abf300642262a3d6c5e14/samples/videoplayer/src/videoPlayerMain/kotlin/VideoPlayer.kt#L159">‍video player</a>), and even <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/85a812064b136557f3dc45a989af1f362cc6301e/tools/benchmarksAnalyzer/src/main/kotlin/main.kt#L131">internally</a>.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Even though the Kotlin/Native compiler is yet to be deeply optimized for performance, this release brings a few improvements that result in some impressive speedups.</p>
<p>The compilation speed, especially for large projects, has been increased by producing native libraries directly from klibs (instead of sources).</p>
<p>The runtime performance has also been improved: interface calls are now up to <strong>5x</strong> faster, and type checks up to <strong>50x</strong> faster!</p>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
<h4>Missing debug information for inlined code</h4>
</dt>
<dd>
Some inlining optimizations were forgetting to update the mapping between source line numbers and binary code location, which resulted in misbehaving breakpoints that would &#8220;overshoot their destination&#8221;.
</dd>
<dd>We&#8217;ve taught them to be more diligent, and now breakpoints work as expected.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
<h4>Passing <code>null</code> to variadic arguments</h4>
</dt>
<dd>
Whenever <code>null</code> was passed as an argument to a function with <code>vararg</code> arguments, such as:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
   platform.posix.printf(&quot;%p&quot;, null)
   </pre>
<p>&#8230;the compiler wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what type to assign to it, and would protest by crashing!
</dd>
<dd>Heeding this, now we treat those values as <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlinx.cinterop/-c-opaque-pointer.html"><code>COpaquePointer</code></a>: the untyped/void pointer, equivalent to <code>void *</code> in C.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
<h4>Unboxing negative values on iOS/macOS</h4>
</dt>
<dd>
Sometimes, handling negative bytes would result in a <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/3290">nasty crash</a>; it turned out to be an LLVM bug, for which we have suggested a manual <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/3290#issuecomment-526137528">workaround</a>.
</dd>
<dd>Starting from this release, the workaround will be applied automatically by the compiler.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kotlin/JS</h2>
<p>In the world of Kotlin/JS, new changes are landing that focus on your quality of life and simplifying working with the new <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin.js</code> plugin, most notably support for source maps and improvements for test runners.</p>
<h3>Source maps</h3>
<p>With Kotlin 1.3.60, source maps are generated automatically for your code that targets JavaScript through the <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin.js</code> Gradle plugin. This makes it a lot more comfortable to debug your own code, as it provides readable stack traces when you run into an error, and equips you with the superpowers provided by the developer tools in the case of targeting the browser – with support for breakpoints, code annotations, information about the local scope, and more. They also simplify working with tests for the JS target, as we will see in the next section.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/source-maps.png" alt="source-maps" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7501" /></p>
<h3>Test runner improvements</h3>
<p>When running your tests on the JS platform, the standard output generated by your tests on the regular channels (ie. <code>log</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>error</code>) is included in the generated Gradle reports. This functionality is available for the Node.js and browser targets. Integration with source maps makes the stack traces of your tests readable and easy to relate to your code – with file names and line numbers pointing directly to your Kotlin sources:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/test-runner.png" alt="test-runner" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7500" /></p>
<p>Test filtering support for the JS target means that tests can be run selectively instead of having to execute all tasks at once. You can use this functionality via the Gradle command line interface through the <code>--tests</code> flag:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
./gradlew browserTest --tests AppTest.testOperationExecution
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the gutter icons in IntelliJ IDEA to run individual tests or tests from a specific set:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2022/11/gutter-icons.png" alt="gutter-icons" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7499" /></p>
<h2 id="upcoming-in-14">Upcoming changes in Kotlin 1.4</h2>
<p>Kotlin 1.4 is planned to be released some time in 2020. However, you can already try some implemented features by specifying the corresponding language version:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
compileKotlin {
    kotlinOptions {
        languageVersion = &quot;1.4&quot;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that so far Kotlin 1.4 is available in the <em>experimental</em> state.</p>
<h3>NPE assertions</h3>
<p>By also setting the <code>apiVersion</code> to <code>1.4</code>, you can observe the changed behavior with null-check optimizations described <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/08/kotlin-1-3-50-released/#npe-optimizations">earlier</a>. The following code now throws a <code>NullPointerException</code> instead of an <code>IllegalStateException</code> with the old message <code>"JavaCode.getNull() must not be null"</code>:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    duplicate(JavaCode.getNull())  // 1
}

fun duplicate(s: String) = s + s
</pre>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
public class JavaCode {
    public static String getNull() { return null; }
}
</pre>
<h3 id="break-and-continue">Break &amp; continue inside <code>when</code></h3>
<p>One of the language changes in Kotlin 1.4 is allowing <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> inside <code>when</code>. Currently, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> expressions without labels are forbidden because these keywords were reserved to possibly be used for fall-through in <code>when</code>. However, using labels turned out to be rather cumbersome, so <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> get their expected meaning inside outer loops:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun foo(list: List&lt;Int&gt;) {
    for (i in list) {
        when (i) {
            42 -&gt; continue
            else -&gt; println(i)
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The fall-through behavior inside <code>when</code> is subject to further design.</p>
<h3>Changes for tail-recursive functions</h3>
<p>We’re going to fix some “corner-case” behavioral peculiarities for tail-recursive functions.</p>
<h4>Initialization order of default values</h4>
<p>The change is only noticeable if your tail-recursive function defines default values <em>with side effects</em>. In Kotlin 1.3, the initialization order of default values inside the <code>tailrec</code> function is wrong: the default values are initialized from the last one to the first one, even though they should be initialized vice versa, from the first one to the last one, as it works for regular functions.</p>
<p>The change is apparent with the following example:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
var counter = 0
fun inc() = counter++

tailrec fun test(i: Int, x: Int = inc(), y: Int = inc()) {
    println(&quot;x: $x, y: $y&quot;)
    if (i &gt; 0) test(i - 1)
}

fun main() {
    test(1)
}
</pre>
<p>The output in Kotlin 1.3 is:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
x: 0, y: 1
x: 3, y: 2
</pre>
<p>In Kotlin 1.4, the output is:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
x: 0, y: 1
x: 2, y: 3
</pre>
<p>We expect that such cases should very rarely occur in practice. (But if for some reason you use this complicated combination of language features, please take note of this upcoming change.)</p>
<h4>Prohibiting <code>open</code> <code>tailrec</code> functions</h4>
<p>In Kotlin 1.3, combining <code>open</code> and <code>tailrec</code> modifiers is a warning, in Kotlin 1.4 it becomes an error. Note that it’s a “breaking change”: code that used to work doesn&#8217;t work anymore, but we don&#8217;t expect this case to ever be used in practice.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether an <code>open</code> tail-recursive function is supposed to behave as a tail-recursive or as an <code>open</code> function primarily. In Kotlin 1.3, the <code>open</code> modifier is “ignored” but that leads to some confusing behavior:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
open class A {
    open tailrec fun foo(count: Int) { // Note: open &amp; tailrec modifiers
        println(&quot;A.foo($count)&quot;)
        if (count &gt; 0) foo(count - 1)
    }
}

class B : A() {
    override fun foo(count: Int) {
        println(&quot;B.foo($count)&quot;)
    }

    fun callSuperFoo(count: Int) = super.foo(count)
}

fun main() {
    B().callSuperFoo(3)
}
</pre>
<p>The output of this code is:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
A.foo(3)
A.foo(2)
A.foo(1)
A.foo(0)
</pre>
<p>The <code>foo</code> function behaves as expected for a tail-recursive function: it calls itself and this call is optimized under the hood.</p>
<p>If we remove the <code>tailrec</code> modifier from the <code>foo</code> function in <code>A</code>, then the output becomes:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
A.foo(3)
B.foo(2)
</pre>
<p>Now the <code>foo</code> function behaves as expected for an <code>open</code> function: at first, <code>super.foo(count)</code> calls explicitly a function from the parent <code>A</code> class. Then <code>foo(count - 1)</code> is a virtual call that calls a function from the <code>B</code> subclass.</p>
<p>Because such behavior is confusing, Kotlin 1.4 prohibits using <code>open</code> and <code>tailrec</code> at the same time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Case Study of the JetBrains Training Partnership</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instil is a software development company based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. They specialize in mobile / cloud projects, consultancy, and training. Their training department is made up of 3 full-time and 4 associate trainers, all of whom have at least 15 years of experience in developing, coaching, and consultancy. </span></em></p>
<p><em>At JetBrains,  we&#8217;re very excited to have partnered with Instil for our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/company/partners/kotlin/">Kotlin Certified Training Program</a>. </em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following post, which tells their Kotlin story, has been written by </span><a href="https://instil.co/training/team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garth Gilmour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Instil.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instil first became involved in Kotlin in 2014. Back then Microservices, Single Page Applications and Cloud were very much in their infancy, and polyglot programming meant some adventurous soul had extended their Grade build file via Groovy. We were very much a traditional JVM shop focused around Java. Several of our developers had successfully completed the Coursera Scala certification and I had written </span><a href="https://instil.co/courses/scala-programming-for-java-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a modestly popular Scala course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there didn’t seem to be much appetite on either the development or the training side for pushing that option any harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was my colleague </span><a href="https://instil.co/training/team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gareth Fleming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who first spotted the merits of Kotlin and began to advocate for it within the company. This was no accident. Gareth has an extensive background in mobile development, but at the time was teaching Java courses in response to overwhelming demand on the services side of the business. So he was well placed to appreciate how Kotlin would be an advantage both to experienced software teams and to graduate developers trying to acclimatise to the JVM ecosystem. Gareth became such a fan he started </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjuAhrDSdoI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speaking on Kotlin at conferences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed to drag me away from Scala (not an easy task at the time) and persuaded our development teams to try Kotlin on new Android projects.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7411" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/09/InstilRebelConWorkshop.jpg" alt="Workshop" width="4032" height="3024" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our software business the rest, as they say, is history. We used Kotlin internally with increasing enthusiasm and started making it an integral part of our sales pitch in 2016. Since then we have delivered multiple projects using Kotlin, including mobile applications, Spring Boot based Web Applications, and Serverless systems deployed to AWS. We actively evangelise Kotlin to the other software companies we work with, and have been instrumental in helping several of them make the switch. As part of this we set up the </span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/kotlin-belfast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belfast Kotlin User Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March of this year, organised </span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Belfast/events/263782918/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Kotlin Everywhere event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are actively collaborating with our sister groups in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. </span></p>
<p>Returning to 2017 those of us working in the services side of the business began to make Kotlin a priority. Every year we take a punt on a technology that we think is going to explode into the near future and write a new classroom-based course from scratch. As a team we decided Kotlin’s star was in the ascendent, so we reached out to JetBrains for some official collaboration. JetBrains were kind enough to provide us with reviews and feedback on the material.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process continued for about six months, with additional feedback from our own coders and the wider development community in Belfast. By January 2018, we were ready to </span><a href="https://instil.co/courses/kotlin-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formally announce the course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so we ran a public training course with Svetlana Isakova (from JetBrains) attending as an official reviewer for the training. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7410" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/09/SvetlanaAtBASHNo2.jpg" alt="Svetlana at BASH Event" width="4000" height="3000" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that first delivery, Kotlin training has become one of our specialities. My colleagues and I have been to Germany, Spain and all over the US to deliver bespoke Kotlin courses. Based on client demand we have written additional courses to </span><a href="https://instil.co/courses/swift-kotlin-android-conversion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convert Swift developers to Kotlin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, explore </span><a href="https://instil.co/courses/kotlin-pure-functional-programming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced Functional Programming techniques</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://instil.co/courses/kotlin-microservices-kafka/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make use of new frameworks like Spring WebFlux and Ktor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the good news about Kotlin has spread, we’ve also been approached to do talks and single-day workshops at Kotlin, including </span><a href="https://gotoams.nl/2019/workshops/172"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOTO Amsterdam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://gotocph.com/2019/workshops/192"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOTO Copenhagen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nidevconf.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NI Dev Conf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A27QdquQaS0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span><a href="https://rebelcon.io/talks/2019/garth-gilmour-coroutines-reactive-streams-and-effects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RebelCon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://conference.accu.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACCU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and (last but definitely not least) </span><a href="https://kotlinconf.com/workshops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KotlinConf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ve had so many invites in 2019 that we ended up putting them on a t-shirt <img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7409" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/09/InstilOnTourTShirts.jpg" alt="InstilOnTourTShirts" width="1600" height="1200" /></p>
<p>We’re hoping to collaborate with the other beneficiaries in 2020. If you are a software team considering Kotlin adoption, I would be unequivocal in recommending that you have a go. All of our experiences have been overwhelmingly positive, and the speed bumps we did encounter were never showstoppers. As a result of adopting Kotlin, both we at Instil and our partners are delivering projects faster, and we see developers having a more positive experience on the JVM.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the second round of our Kotlin Heroes programming contest taking place on the Codeforces platform. JetBrains is working once again with Codeforces to promote Kotlin in the competitive programming community, as well as to give the Kotlin community a platform to compare and hone their algorithmic programming skills. We hope that any of you who entered our first round on the 22nd of May this year will join us again now you know what to expect and try to improve (or at least hold) your standing on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>You can see the standings from the first Kotlin heroes <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1170/standings?locale=en">here</a>, it was a closely fought contest. We would like to thank everyone for entering and submitting their answers and congratulate the top 3 winners <strong><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Petr">Petr</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/ecnerwala">ecnerwala</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/abacabadabacaba">abacabadabacaba</a></strong> on their incredible achievement, especially considering they were up against 4,500 other registrants from over 63 countries. We’d also like to give a shout out to <strong><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist">tourist</a></strong>, for being the only other person who managed to solve every problem set.</p>
<p>Episode 2 of the Kotlin Heroes competition will be hosted again on Codeforces, this time on the 7th of September, 2019, at 14:35 UTC (17:35 MSK, 07:35 PDT, 22:35 CST). The contest will last 2,5 hours and will feature a set of problems designed for both beginners and seasoned competitive programmers alike. The top three winners will receive prizes of $512, $256, and $128, respectively. The top 50 contestants will win a Kotlin Heroes t-shirt and an exclusive Kotlin badge. Finally, every competitor who solves at least one problem will enter a draw for one of the 50 exclusive Kotlin Heroes t-shirts.</p>
<p align="center"><a class="jb-download-button" title="Join Kotlin Heroes!" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/promo/kotlin-heroes/">Join Kotlin Heroes!</a></p>
<p><span id="more-7401"></span></p>
<p>Whether you are a long-time competitive programmer or a Kotlin developer who has never participated in a programming contest before, we think you’ll find Kotlin Heroes a useful, entertaining, and thought-provoking contest to be a part of to gain more experience.</p>
<p>Contests are a great way to test your programming knowledge and improve it. It is a mind sport where contestants write programs to solve precisely formulated algorithmic problems within strict constraints. Problems can range from simple ones, which can be solved by any developer and require little code to achieve the correct solution, to complex ones that require knowledge of specific algorithms and data structures and lots of experience. Codeforces is a platform that brings together professional developers and students from all over the world for education, fun, and the opportunity to improve their programming skills.</p>
<p>If you find Kotlin a fun and enjoyable language, we think you will enjoy participating in Kotlin Heroes and maybe even using Kotlin in other programming contests! We wish you good luck and have a nice Kotlin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to announce the release of Kotlin 1.3.50 today. In addition to the quality and tooling improvements, the main focus for this version has been on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing a new Duration and Time Measurement API (available for preview).</li>
<li>Working on an improved Java-to-Kotlin converter.</li>
<li>Experimental generation of external declarations for npm dependencies in Gradle Kotlin/JS projects (using Dukat).</li>
<li>A separate plugin for debugging Kotlin/Native code in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.</li>
<li>Java compilation support in multiplatform projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the complete list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/1.3.50/ChangeLog.md">change log</a>. As always, we’d like to thank our <a href="#external-contributions">external contributors</a>. Now let’s dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="npe-optimizations">Null-check optimizations planned for Kotlin 1.4</h2>
<p>As you probably know, Kotlin decreases the possibility of <code>NullPointerException</code>s by providing support for nullable types. However, because of interoperability with Java code, it’s impossible to avoid NPEs completely. To help developers better understand the source of a nullability problem if it occurs, Kotlin compiler throws different types of runtime exceptions with clear error messages instead of pure NPEs. It turned out that this approach has its disadvantages: it reduces possible null check optimizations that can be performed either by the Kotlin compiler or by various kinds of bytecode processing tools, such as the Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code">R8 optimizer</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7309"></span></p>
<p>To solve this, starting from Kotlin 1.4, all runtime null checks will throw a <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code> instead of a <code>KotlinNullPointerException</code>, <code>IllegalStateException</code>, <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>, and <code>TypeCastException</code>. This applies to: the <code>!!</code> operator, parameter null checks in the method preamble, platform-typed expression null checks, and the <code>as</code> operator with a non-null type. This doesn’t apply to <code>lateinit</code> null checks and explicit library function calls like <code>checkNotNull</code> or <code>requireNotNull</code>.</p>
<p>Note that from a developer&#8217;s perspective, things won’t change that much: the Kotlin code will throw exceptions with the same error messages as before. <em>The type</em> of exception changes, but the information passed stays the same. For instance, the following code currently throws an <code>IllegalStateException</code> with the error message “JavaCode.getNull() must not be null”:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    duplicate(JavaCode.getNull())  // 1
}

fun duplicate(s: String) = s + s
</pre>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
public class JavaCode {
    public static String getNull() { return null; }
}
</pre>
<p>Right before the <code>duplicate</code> function call at line <code>1</code>, a special check is generated which throws this exception if the expression <code>JavaCode.getNull()</code> stores <code>null</code>. Starting with Kotlin 1.4, this code will throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> instead with the same message, “JavaCode.getNull() must not be null”.</p>
<p>After this change of behavior, the optimizers will be able to decrease the total number of null-checks present in the bytecode by removing repetitive null-checks when possible: since all checks throw the same NPE exception, only one can remain. During such optimizations, the specific helpful messages of NPEs can be lost, but that’s the price to be paid for the gained performance benefits. Note that these optimizations are still to be implemented in the corresponding tools, and when implemented, there will be more details about that, but the change of the exception type makes it possible in the future.</p>
<h2>Standard library changes</h2>
<p>Note that all new functions are added to the standard library in the &#8220;experimental&#8221; state.</p>
<h3>Duration and time measurement API</h3>
<p>A new duration and time measurement API is available for preview. Duration can be measured in a variety of units: seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds, etc. The confusion between different units is a known source of bugs: if the API expects the duration stored as primitive value like <code>Long</code>, one can erroneously pass the value in the wrong unit, and unfortunately the type system doesn’t help prevent that. Creating a regular class to store duration solves this problem, but brings another one: additional allocations.</p>
<p>Inline classes provide a very elegant solution to that: they bring both type system guarantees and an allocation-free approach. Now the API can use the <code>Duration</code> type, and all the clients will need to specify the time in the desired units explicitly. Since <code>Duration</code> is declared as an inline class, no extra allocations are happening under the hood:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
import kotlin.time.*

@ExperimentalTime
suspend fun greetAfterTimeout(duration: Duration) {
    delay(duration.toLongMilliseconds())
    println(&quot;Hi!&quot;)
}

@UseExperimental(ExperimentalTime::class)
suspend fun main() {
    greetAfterTimeout(100.milliseconds)
    greetAfterTimeout(1.seconds)
}
</pre>
<p>This release brings support for <code>MonoClock</code> which represents the <em>monotonic clock</em>. The recommended approach to measuring time duration from a given point in your program is to use the monotonic clock, which doesn’t depend on the system time. System time might be changed outside, and that might lead to erroneous behavior. The monotonic clock can only measure time difference between given time points, but doesn’t know the “current time.”</p>
<p>The <code>Clock</code> interface provides a general API for measuring time intervals. <code>MonoClock</code> is an object implementing <code>Clock</code>; it provides the default source of monotonic time on different platforms.</p>
<p>When using the <code>Clock</code> interface, you explicitly mark the time of action start, and later the time elapsed from the start point. It is especially convenient if you want to start and finish measuring time from different functions:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
import kotlin.time.*

@UseExperimental(ExperimentalTime::class)
fun main() {
    val clock = MonoClock
    val mark = clock.markNow() // might be inside the first function
    Thread.sleep(10)           // action
    println(mark.elapsedNow()) // might be inside the second function
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>measureTimedValue</code> function allows you to measure the duration of a given action and get its result together with the duration of the elapsed time interval. It measures the elapsed time with <code>MonoClock</code>.</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
import kotlin.time.*

@UseExperimental(ExperimentalTime::class)
fun main() {
    val (value, duration) = measureTimedValue {
        Thread.sleep(100)
        42
    }
    println(value)     // 42
    println(duration)  // e.g. 103 ms
}
</pre>
<p>For more details about the implementation of the <code>Duration</code> class and the details of the <code>Clock</code> interface and <code>MonoClock</code> implementations for different platforms, please refer to the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/durations/proposals/stdlib/durations-and-clocks.md">KEEP</a>. Note that this API is experimental and is subject to change based on your feedback. You will need to explicitly give your consent to use it by applying the corresponding <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/experimental.html">annotations</a>.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to your feedback!</p>
<h3>Functions for bit manipulation</h3>
<p>The standard library now contains an API for bit manipulation (as usual, in the experimental state initially):</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
@UseExperimental(ExperimentalStdlibApi::class)
fun main() {
    val number = &quot;1010000&quot;.toInt(radix = 2)
    println(number.countOneBits())
    println(number.countTrailingZeroBits())
    println(number.takeHighestOneBit().toString(2))
    println(number.rotateRight(3).toString(2))
    println(number.rotateLeft(3).toString(2))
}
</pre>
<p>Note that similar extension functions for Int, Long, Short, Byte, and their unsigned counterparts have been added.</p>
<h2>IntelliJ IDEA support</h2>
<h3>Improved Java to Kotlin converter</h3>
<p>We plan to improve the Java-to-Kotlin converter to minimize the amount of “red code” one has to fix manually after the conversion. As the current converter almost always generates non-nullable types, you need to fix the nullability issues by hand afterward. It can often lead to runtime errors from nullability mismatch later.</p>
<p>The new, improved version of the Java-to-Kotlin converter tries to infer nullability more correctly based on the Java type usages in the code. Note that there’s no goal to produce 100% error-free code. The goal is to decrease the number of compilation errors and to make the produced Kotlin code more convenient to work with. The new converter fixes many other known bugs, too; for instance, it now correctly handles implicit Java type casts.</p>
<p>In the future, the new converter is going to become the default one. In this release, it’s available for preview. To turn it on, specify the <code>Use New J2K (experimental)</code> flag in settings.</p>
<p>Please give it a try and share your feedback with us!</p>
<h3>Debugging improvements</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve improved how the Kotlin “Variables” view chooses the variables to display. As there’s a lot of additional technical information in the bytecode, the Kotlin “Variables” view highlights only the relevant variables. Now it works better when you set a breakpoint inside a lambda (either inlined or non-inlined). Local variables inside the lambda, as well as captured variables from the outer context and parameters of the outer function, are correctly displayed:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/debug_lambda_variables.png" alt="debug_lambda_variables" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7312" /></p>
<p>You can now set a breakpoint at the end of the function, if needed:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/end_of_function_breakpoint.png" alt="end_of_function_breakpoint" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7313" /></p>
<p>Support for the “Evaluate expression” functionality in the debugger was improved for many non-trivial language features, such as local extension functions or accessors of member extension properties. Also, you can now modify variables via “Evaluate expression”:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7314" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/evaluate_expression2.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/evaluate_expression2.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/evaluate_expression2.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Note that, alternatively, you can modify variables in the “Variables” view directly.</p>
<h3>New intentions and inspections</h3>
<p>New intentions and inspections have been added. One of the goals of intentions is to help you learn how to write idiomatic Kotlin code. The following intention, for instance, suggests using the <code>indices</code> property rather than building a range of indices manually:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7314" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/indices2.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/indices-gif.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/indices2.png';" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>If the index isn’t used, the loop can be automatically replaced with a for loop over elements.</p>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can automatically replace the <code>lateinit</code> property of a primitive type with the <code>by Delegates.notNull()</code> syntax.</li>
<li>Can convert a regular property to a lazy one and back.</li>
<li>Detects usages of Java methods for array comparison (like <code>Arrays.equals()</code> or <code>Array.deepEquals()</code>) and suggest replacing them with their Kotlin counterparts (like <code>contentEquals</code> and <code>contentDeepEquals</code>).</li>
<li>Highlights the deprecated import in the completion list.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/deprecated_imports.png" alt="deprecated_imports" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7316" /></p>
<p>The general performance of IDE actions has been improved, and several known situations that were causing the UI to freeze (such as calling the “Move” refactoring on a file with a huge number of usages) have been fixed.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/JS</h2>
<p>This update adds support for building and running Kotlin/JS Gradle projects using the <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin.js</code> plugin on Windows. Just like on other platforms, you can build and run your projects using Gradle tasks, dependencies from NPM required in your Gradle configuration are resolved and included, you can try out your applications using webpack-dev-server (e.g. by invoking the <code>browserRun</code> Gradle task), and more. As with the other platforms, all of this can be used without having to manually install and manage a node, npm, or yarn distribution.</p>
<p>Under the hood, there have also been a series of performance improvements for Kotlin/JS, improving the incremental compilation time for projects. This means that you can expect speedups of up to 30% when compared to 1.3.41.</p>
<p>Our improved integration with NPM means that projects are now resolved lazily and in parallel, and support for projects with transitive dependencies between compilations in the same project has been added.</p>
<p>The new version also brings with it changes in the structure and naming of generated artifacts. Generated artifacts are now bundled in the distributions folder, and they include the version number of the project and <code>archiveBaseName</code> (which defaults to the project name), e.g. <code>projectName-1.0-SNAPSHOT.js</code>.</p>
<h3>Dukat</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat">Dukat</a> allows the automatic conversion of TypeScript declaration files (<code>.d.ts</code>) into Kotlin external declarations (and thus replaces the <code>ts2kt</code> command-line tool). This makes it more comfortable to use libraries from the JavaScript ecosystem in a type-safe manner in Kotlin, by drastically reducing the need for manually writing wrappers for JS libraries.</p>
<p>Kotlin/JS now ships with experimental support for dukat integration for Gradle projects. With this integration, by running the build task in Gradle, typesafe wrappers are <em>automatically</em> generated for npm dependencies and can be used from Kotlin.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/kotlin-dukat-preview-1.png" alt="kotlin-dukat-preview" width="902" height="542" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7362" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/kotlin-dukat-video.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/kotlin-dukat-preview-1.png';"/></p>
<p>Because dukat is still in a very early stage, its integration is disabled by default. Add the <code>kotlin.js.experimental.generateKotlinExternals=true</code> line into the <code>gradle.properties</code> file in a project root directory to turn on dukat for your project. We&#8217;ve prepared an <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-js-demo-1.3.50">example project</a> for it too, which demonstrates the use of dukat in Kotlin/JS projects. Try it out and share your <a href="https://github.com/kotlin/dukat/issues">feedback</a> with us.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native</h2>
<p>It was not easy but possible to notice that the version of Kotlin/Native differed from the version of Kotlin. Not anymore! The version schemes for Kotlin and Kotlin/Native are now aligned. This release uses version 1.3.50 for both Kotlin and Kotlin/Native binaries, reducing the complexity.</p>
<p>This release brings more pre-imported Apple frameworks for all platforms, including macOS and iOS. The Kotlin/Native compiler now includes actual bitcode in produced frameworks.</p>
<p>Several improvements have been made for interop. We now support the <code>kotlin.Deprecated</code> annotation when producing a framework, and the generated Objective-C headers code will not have warnings. The <code>getOriginalKotlinClass()</code> function is added into the standard library to get a <code>KClass</code> from an Objective-C class or protocols.</p>
<p>The standard library has been updated to support the <code>kotlin.reflect.typeOf()</code> function for Kotlin/Native types. The new function <code>executeAfter()</code> is added to the <code>Worker</code> type to execute actions after a delay. In addition, you can call the <code>processQueue()</code> function on the <code>Worker</code> to process the tasks queue explicitly.</p>
<p>The older functions <code>ByteArray.stringFromUtf8()</code> and <code>ByteArray.stringFromUtf8OrThrow()</code> are now deprecated. In the previous release, we added the <code>ByteArray.decodeToString()</code> function (in the <code>kotlin.text</code> package) to convert a UTF-8 string to a Kotlin string. That function does not support NULL-terminated strings, so to fix that, in 1.3.50 we&#8217;ve added a new function to deal with NULL-terminated UTF-8 strings easily. The <code>ByteArray.toKString()</code> function (from the <code>kotlinx.cinterop</code> package) can be used to turn a NULL-terminated UTF-8 string into a Kotlin string. You can pass start and end indices to the function if needed.</p>
<p>We’ve deprecated and removed the <code>kotlin-platform-native</code> Gradle plugin in favor of the <code>kotlin-multiplatform</code> Gradle plugin, so now you can easily benefit from all multiplatform project features. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/master/GRADLE_PLUGIN.md">documentation</a> for the migration guide and more info</p>
<p>Finally, we are happy to share that the Kotlin/Native compiler and the interop tool performance has been improved in this release.</p>
<h2>Multiplatform Projects</h2>
<p>Java compilation can now be included in Kotlin/JVM targets of a multiplatform project by calling the newly added <code>withJava()</code> function of the DSL. It will configure Java plugin to use the <code>src/&lt;targetName&gt;Main/java</code> and <code>src/&lt;targetName&gt;Test/java</code> paths by default. Here is a full example to create a Kotlin/JVM target with enabled Java compilation:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
plugins { 
    kotlin(&quot;multiplatform&quot;) version &quot;1.3.50&quot;
}
kotlin {
    jvm {
        withJava()
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Kotlin&#8217;s New Project wizard now generates Gradle Kotlin DSL for new projects.</p>
<p>Debugging Kotlin/Native code in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is now supported too! Try installing the new <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12775-native-debug-for-intellij">Native Debug for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</a> plugin. It should detect Kotlin/Native run configurations and the debug action is supported:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/08/debugging-kotlin-native-1.3.50.png" alt="debugging-kotlin-native-1.3.50" width="1620" height="1516" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7335" /></p>
<h2>Scripting</h2>
<p>This release adds multiple features and improvements in scripting and REPL support. Using Kotlin as a scripting language for your application is even easier! Now the scripting support works out of the box: we’ve published a default JSR-223 implementation library, so to add Kotlin scripting support for your application, you only need to add <code>kotlin-scripting-jsr223</code> as a dependency and use the <code>javax.script</code> API with Kotlin.</p>
<p>Properties that are set via the JSR-223 API are now accessible from scripts as regular Kotlin properties (before, that you had to use the <code>bindings</code> map):</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
val engine = ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByExtension(&quot;kts&quot;)!!
engine.put(&quot;z&quot;, 42)
engine.eval(&quot;&quot;&quot;println(&quot;answer = $z&quot;)&quot;&quot;&quot;)
</pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/scripting-support.md#kotlin-main-kts">The <code>kotlin-main-kts</code> artifact</a>, which was introduced in Kotlin 1.3 to simplify the creation and usage of the basic utility scripts, can now be used as a JSR-223 host as well. In addition to the annotations like <code>Repository</code> and <code>DependsOn</code> for resolving dependencies, it now supports the <code>@Import</code> annotation instructing the scripting compiler to &#8220;import&#8221; another script into the current one:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// common.main.kts:
val foo = &quot;common foo&quot;
</pre>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// script.main.kts:
@file:Import(&quot;common.main.kts&quot;)
val bar = &quot;bar with $foo&quot;
</pre>
<p>Read more about scripting in <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/scripting-support.md">KEEP-75</a>. You can find <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/examples/scripting">examples</a> in the Kotlin repository.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at the O’Reilly Open Source Awards 2019, we were honored to hear that Kotlin has won the prestigious Breakout Project of the Year award, this award recognizes a project that has started “breaking out in a big way” over the past year, which we are really happy about. We want to say a massive thank you to O’Reilly OSCON for this recognition, but more importantly, we want to take a minute to thank the incredible Kotlin community who have brought the project to where it is today.</p>
<p>Since our first commit to the GitHub repository on the 7th of November, 2010, we have watched in awe as the open-source community has embraced the language and driven it forward with their contribution, support, and ideas which have gone into the language we are all very proud of.</p>
<p>There is still work to do, but as long as we have such an incredible community behind us we know we can make this language what it needs to be for developers. If you haven&#8217;t used Kotlin yet, we would love to have you try. Your contributions and feedback are what help us improve. Get involved in the evolution of the language and let&#8217;s see how far we can go together.</p>
<p>Again, to everyone who has helped make Kotlin the success it is today, thank you and have a nice Kotlin! <img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to present the new release today, Kotlin 1.3.40. In addition to the quality and tooling improvements the main focus for this version has been on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradle support for NPM, Yarn, and Webpack for Kotlin/JS</li>
<li>Test runner improvements for multiplatform projects</li>
<li>New type inference</li>
<li>Performance and interoperability improvements for Kotlin/Native</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, new functions were added to the standard library in an experimental state.</p>
<p>You can find the complete list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/1.3.40/ChangeLog.md">change log</a>. As always, we’re really grateful to our <a href="#external-contributions">external contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details!</p>
<p><span id="more-7189"></span></p>
<h2>Experimental functions in the standard library</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve added several new functions to the standard library in an experimental state. There are new common functions to encode/decode a byte/char array into a string in a UTF-8 encoding included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ByteArray.decodeToString</code> and <code>String.encodeToByteArray</code></li>
<li><code>CharArray.concatToString</code> and <code>String.toCharArray</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Another experimental function <code>capitalize</code> has been added on the JVM which takes <code>Locale</code> object as a parameter.</p>
<p>You need to explicitly opt-in to use them: either annotate the use site with <code>@UseExperimental(ExperimentalStdlibApi::class)</code> or provide the compiler argument <code>-Xuse-experimental=kotlin.ExperimentalStdlibApi</code>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7192" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/experimentalAPI.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/experimentalAPI.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/experimentalAPI.png';" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <code>ExperimentalStdlibApi</code> annotation was introduced in this release to indicate experimental API in the standard library. The behavior of such API can change based on your feedback, so there is no compatibility guarantee. You can find more about the experimental annotations in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/experimental.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="type-of">Accessing the reified type using reflection on JVM</h3>
<p>Another experimental function added in this release is the <code>typeOf</code> function. At a glance, you can use it to construct an instance of <code>KType</code> for a given type:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
val intType: KType = typeOf&lt;Int&gt;()
println(String::length.returnType == intType) // true
</pre>
<p>The real benefit, however, comes when you use it to retrieve information about the reified generic type argument. When you call <code>typeOf()</code> with <code>T</code> being a reified generic type argument, <code>typeOf</code> returns the actual value of the type argument:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
@UseExperimental(ExperimentalStdlibApi::class)
inline fun &lt;reified T&gt; accessReifiedTypeArg() {
    val kType = typeOf&lt;T&gt;()
    println(kType.toString())
}

fun main() {
    accessReifiedTypeArg&lt;String&gt;() // kotlin.String
    accessReifiedTypeArg&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;() // kotlin.collections.List&lt;kotlin.String&gt;
}
</pre>
<p>Currently, <code>typeOf</code> is only available in Kotlin/JVM, but in future versions, similar functions will be added to the other platforms: Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Native.</p>
<h2>Optimization for trimIndent and trimMargin</h2>
<p>For better code formatting, multiline strings are usually used together with either <code>trimIndent</code> or <code>trimMargin</code>. Starting with this release, <code>trimIndent</code> and <code>trimMargin</code> calls are optimized by the compiler. Instead of calling the corresponding library functions, the compiler does the work itself and generates the trimmed string literals in the bytecode:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    println(
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
             |first
                |second
            &quot;&quot;&quot;.trimMargin()
    )

    // in the bytecode it is replaced with:
    println(&quot;first\nsecond&quot;)
}
</pre>
<p>Note that this optimization only works if the receiver function and the margin prefix are constant expressions, without any interpolated variables (like <code>"$x"</code>).</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-30451">optimization</a> <code>minBy</code> and <code>maxBy</code> functions do not call the specified <code>selector</code> function any longer if the collection they were invoked on contains just one element. Beware if you relied on side effects from <code>selector</code> function.</p>
<h2>Using External annotations in IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
<p>If you use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/external-annotations.html">external nullability annotations for Java</a>, the IDE can now give warnings for incorrect usages of annotated Java methods from Kotlin.</p>
<p>Imagine that your Java method is annotated with an external annotation. IntelliJ IDEA can show such an annotation, but it’s not present in the code:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7194" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/annotatedJavaMethod.png" alt="annotatedJavaMethod" width="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7194" /></p>
<p>The annotation is declared in a separate <code>annotations.xml</code> file:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;item name="JavaClass java.lang.String nullableString()"&gt;
        &lt;annotation name="org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable"/&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;</pre><p></p>
<p>Starting from this release, you&#8217;ll get warnings for incorrect usages of this Java method from Kotlin:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7195" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/nullabilityWarning.png" alt="nullabilityWarning" width="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7195"/></p>
<p>Note that this is purely IDE functionality; the corresponding code is compiled without warnings by the Kotlin compiler. The compiler still infers that the type of <code>nullableString</code> is a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types">platform type</a> <code>String!</code>, but the IDE shows an additional warning.</p>
<h2 id="new-type-inference">Working on a New Type Inference Algorithm</h2>
<p>We’ve been working on an improved algorithm for type inference. It fixes different corner-case problems and supports new scenarios: <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=%23fixed-in-new-inference%20">the whole list of fixed issues</a> is quite impressive. In future versions of Kotlin, the new algorithm will replace the one currently in use and will become the default.</p>
<p>The backward compatibility when switching to the new algorithm is really important to us. So, we have switched it on by default <em>only</em> in the IDE for this release, to gather feedback from real-life examples. Note that it&#8217;s possible that the code works correctly in the IDE but isn’t supported by the compiler since different bugs related to type inference for complicated corner-cases were fixed. If you observe any inconsistent behavior when the code is red in the IDE but compiles fine with the Kotlin compiler or vice versa, please let us know by <a href="http://kotl.in/issue">filing a new issue</a>. If this mode doesn’t work well for your projects, you can switch it off by unselecting the checkbox <code>Enable new type inference algorithm for IDE analysis</code> in the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiler-kotlin-compiler.html">Kotlin Compiler tab in Preferences</a> (in Android Studio the option is located in a different place: Preferences | Kotlin Compiler).</p>
<p>We are looking forward to your feedback!</p>
<h2>Multiplatform Projects (MPP)</h2>
<p>Test runners for Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS now implement all Gradle Test runner APIs and behave in a way similar to the Kotlin/JVM test runner. Test failure reports with source code navigation will be printed into the console. A test report will be generated by Gradle too. Test filtering parameters are also supported via the standard Gradle parameter, e.g. <code>--tests some.test.ClassName</code>.</p>
<p>A combined test run report can be generated from Gradle to include all information in all test runs on all targets, including Kotlin/Native, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/JVM.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7248" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/2019-06-17_17-08-16.png" alt="kotlin-1.3.40-test-runner-report" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7248" /></p>
<h2>Kotlin/JS</h2>
<p>Kotlin/JS incremental compilation performance has been improved. In particular, the compilation time of large projects and/or modules with lots of dependencies is reduced by up to 30% in some cases.</p>
<p>The most visible changes to Kotlin/JS in this release are from the tooling side. We are happy to introduce the updated Kotlin/JS plugin for Gradle, we&#8217;ve renamed it <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin.js</code> and it is now available on the <a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.jetbrains.kotlin.js">Gradle plugin portal</a>. Just use the <code>plugins {}</code> syntax in your <code>build.gradle</code> to enable it:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
plugins {
    id(&quot;org.jetbrains.kotlin.js&quot;) version &quot;1.3.40&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>or use the <code>kotlin</code> function in <code>build.gradle.kts</code>:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
plugins {
    kotlin(&quot;js&quot;) version &quot;1.3.40&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>We are working hard to port all the features of the <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-frontend-plugin">kotlin-frontend-plugin</a> plugin into our Kotlin/JS plugin and Kotlin/Multiplatform plugins. Some of the features are already included as experimental. We plan to deprecate the <code>kotlin-frontend-plugin</code> when this work is complete.</p>
<h3>Experimental support for NPM and Webpack</h3>
<p>Today, we are happy to share with you a few more experimental features to help simplify the development of JavaScript projects that use Node.js, NPM, Yarn, or Webpack. We&#8217;ve added helper tasks to both Kotlin/JS and Multiplatform Gradle plugins to simplify the integration. The plugin will generate a temporary <code>package.json</code> for your project, and it will download and use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a> to manage the NPM dependencies and <code>node_modules</code> automatically. Webpack will be used behind the scenes to join all the dependencies and create browser-friendly scripts from your code.</p>
<p>The plugin attaches all your Kotlin/JS dependencies declared in a Gradle project to the automatically maintained <code>node_modules</code> folder. Adding an NPM dependency is now supported in Gradle scripts via the newly added <code>npm</code> function in the <code>dependencies {}</code> block of a JS SourceSet:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
dependencies {
    implementation(npm(&quot;react&quot;, &quot;16.8.3&quot;))
}
</pre>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/">Yarn Workspaces</a> are used for <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/creating-multi-project-builds/">Multi-Project Gradle builds</a>. A workspace is created per sub-project and configured under the root project&#8217;s build directory. This allows Yarn to reduce <code>node_modules</code> copies in sub-projects by extracting common dependencies to root <code>node_modules</code>.</p>
<h3>Node.js and Browser Modes</h3>
<p>Running or testing JavaScript projects has always depended on the environment. We&#8217;ve now added support for Node.js and browser execution environments. You may use <code>nodejs {}</code> or <code>browser {}</code> functions to configure the Kotlin target for both Kotlin/JS and Multiplatform Gradle plugins.</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {
    //use js() for a multiplatform project
    target {
        nodejs()
        browser()
    }

    sourceSets[&quot;main&quot;].dependencies {
        implementation(kotlin(&quot;stdlib-js&quot;))
        implementation(npm(&quot;react&quot;, &quot;16.8.3&quot;))
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The Gradle plugin will download and install (via Yarn, of course) all the required NPM dependencies, including a headless browser for Karma tests, to run the tests for your code. Mocha test framework will be used to run your tests in a Node.js environment. Test runners are integrated with Gradle and implement similar features as are available for Kotlin/JVM tests. For example, test failures are shown in the console, tests report will be generated, a test filter may be passed to the Gradle command line.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is hard to trace an error back to the point in the code to improve it, so we&#8217;ve added JavaScript source maps support to all these tasks in our Gradle plugin.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7257" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/kotlin-1.3.40-tests.png" alt="kotlin-1.3.40-tests" width="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7257"  onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/kotlin-1.3.40-tests-3.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/06/kotlin-1.3.40-tests.png';"/></p>
<p>You may easily configure to run browser tests in different browsers. The plugin will configure NPM dependencies for the Karma test runner to make it happen. The following DSL can be used in Gradle:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {
    //use js() for multiplatform project
    target {
        browser {
            testTask {
                useKarma {
                    useIe()
                    useSafari()
                    useFirefox()
                    useChrome()
                    useChromeCanary()
                    useChromeHeadless()
                    usePhantomJS()
                    useOpera()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>A <code>run</code> task was also added to the Gradle plugin to execute the Kotlin/JS code in Node.js or Browser environments.</p>
<p>Note, the new Kotlin/JS build features are experimental and currently only supported on macOS and Linux. Windows support will be added later.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native</h2>
<p>Several improvements were <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/2813">added</a> in the memory manager to improve the performance of Kotlin/Native applications. We&#8217;ve noticed nearly twice the performance boost to our benchmarks.</p>
<p>ARM x64 (ARM/AArch64) support is added for Linux targets. The <code>CoreLocation</code> framework is pre-imported and included out of the box on macOS. We&#8217;ve improved logging and error messages that are shown by the Kotlin/Native compiler.</p>
<p><code>FreezableAtomicReference</code> is a new experimental <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/2776">class</a> included in Kotlin/Native to help deal with multiple threads and concurrency. It behaves like an <code>AtomicReference</code> class, no matter if it is frozen or not.</p>
<p><code>kotlin-platform-native</code> is now deprecated. Please migrate to the <code>kotlin-multiplatform</code> Gradle plugin. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/master/GRADLE_PLUGIN.md">documentation</a> for the migration guide and more info.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also removed the previously deprecated API in the <code>kotlin-multiplatform</code> Gradle plugin to configure Kotlin/Native targets. Starting from 1.3.40, the <code>compilations.outputKinds</code> is no longer supported, please use the <code>binaries</code> API instead.</p>
<h3>Interop</h3>
<p>Experimental generics support for Kotlin/Native produced frameworks is <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/2850">included</a>. It adds type information for generic parameters to Kotlin/Native generic classes for Objective-C/Swift. The feature is disabled by default, to enable it, pass the <code>-Xobjc-generics</code> command line argument to the compiler or add these lines to the Gradle project configuration:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {
    iosX64 {
        binaries {
            framework {
                freeCompilerArgs.add(&quot;-Xobjc-generics&quot;)
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In addition to this, the Kotlin type <code>Unit</code> will turn into <code>Void</code> in the produced frameworks. Kotlin/Native method names will not clash with Objective-C declarations, because we&#8217;ve improved the way method names are <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/2914">generated</a>. Variadic Objective-C functions are now <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/pull/2896">supported</a> in the interop.</p>
<p>Nullable strings are now correctly <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2956">supported</a> in the C interop. We&#8217;ve fixed <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2941">issues</a> with the custom exception hook; now you can use the <code>setUnhandledExceptionHook {}</code> function in your code to catch unhandled Kotlin exceptions.</p>
<h3>Tests in Kotlin/Native</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve added a separate binary type for Kotlin/Native test targets. Now it is easier to instruct the build to create a native tests executable:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin.macosX64 {
    binaries {
        test(&quot;integration&quot;) {
            /* configuration if needed */
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Kotlin/Native test runner is now integrated with Gradle and implements features similar to those available for Kotlin/JVM tests, for example, test failures are shown in the console, tests report will be generated, and you may pass a tests filter to the Gradle command line.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s easier to get the test binary via Gradle API using the <code>binaries.getTest</code> function. The old ways to find test executables, e.g., <code>binaries.getExecutable("test", "DEBUG")</code>, will not work anymore, please use the new API instead: <code>binaries.getTest("DEBUG")</code>.</p>
<h2>How to update</h2>
<p>As always, you can <strong>try Kotlin online</strong> at <a href="http://play.kotl.in/">play.kotl.in</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Maven, Gradle, and npm</strong>: Use <code>1.3.40</code> as the version for the compiler and the standard library. See the docs <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>In IntelliJ IDEA</strong> and <strong>Android Studio</strong>: Update the Kotlin plugin to version 1.3.40. Use <em>Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates</em> and click the “Check for updates now” button.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kotlin 1.0 was released 3 years ago. It has been an amazing journey and a huge achievement to get to where we are today: Kotlin/Native has opened up incredible possibilities for Kotlin usage on all platforms, Kotlin was announced as a first-class language on Android, and our KotlinConf has become a successful annual event. The potential for the language is immense: every year Kotlin users double in number. Programmers all over the world are using Kotlin to create their server- and client-side web applications, Android and iOS mobile applications, and even data science.</p>
<p>This is the first year when we present the Kotlin Census infographics report to provide you with more insights and trends around Kotlin. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/kotlin-census-2018/">Check it out!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/kotlin-census-2018/"><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/05/Kotlin_Census_2018_blogpost_1@2.png" alt="Kotlin_Census_2018_blogpost_1@2" width="3200" height="1600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7153" /></a><br />
<span id="more-7145"></span></p>
<h2>Methodology and general overview</h2>
<p>We received 4,396 responses through our official Kotlin channels between December 2018 and March 2019 (these responses were not limited to only those who use Kotlin). The most meaningful insights have been made into an infographic and text report.</p>
<p>We were excited to learn that Kotlin is the primary language for 39% of respondents, 46% use it for server-side production code, and 10% use Kotlin for data science. Usage of coroutines has doubled in comparison to the year before. The total usage of libraries has also doubled, and the popularity of the libraries continues to grow.</p>
<h2>Community contribution and growth</h2>
<p>Today more than 2 million people use Kotlin on every kind of platform, for the development of all possible types of software. More than 250 contributors help drive development and the ecosystem forward. We are very happy with the dedication and hard work of our community who have contributed so much to the Kotlin learning materials and spreading Kotlin knowledge.</p>
<p>It was exciting to see community-driven learning resources such as Stack Overflow and blog posts overtaking official documentation in popularity among Kotlin adopters in 2018. We support this all the way and we want to thank all the authors and speakers out there for sharing their Kotlin knowledge!</p>
<h4>You can find more insights like these in the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/kotlin-census-2018/">Kotlin Census 2018 report</a>. We also have the raw data available there, should you want to dig deeper and find more insights.</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to announce the release of Kotlin 1.3.30, a new bug fix and tooling update for Kotlin 1.3. The main areas of focus for this release have been around Kotlin/Native, KAPT performance, as well as improvements for IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>You can find the complete list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/1.3.30/ChangeLog.md">change log</a>. As always, we’d like to thank our <a href="#external-contributions">external contributors</a>. Now let’s dive into the details!</p>
<p><span id="more-6991"></span></p>
<h2>Incremental annotation processing in KAPT</h2>
<p>KAPT now supports incremental annotation processors in an experimental mode. To try it, add the following setting to <code>gradle.properties</code> file:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kapt.incremental.apt=true
</pre>
<p>Note that in the current implementation, using any non-incremental annotation processor or a change in dependency&#8217;s ABI (so far, including modifying internal declarations) will lead to non-incremental annotation processing for a given module.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still work in progress and it&#8217;s going to be improved in future releases, but we encourage you to try it now and share your feedback!</p>
<h3>KAPT: other performance improvements</h3>
<p>Back in 1.2.60, we introduced two options to improve build performance. The first one was <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html#running-kapt-tasks-in-parallel-since-1260">using Gradle workers</a>:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kapt.use.worker.api=true
</pre>
<p>and it has been improved with this release.</p>
<p>The second option introduced, this time in 1.3.20, enabled <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html#compile-avoidance-for-kapt-since-1320">Compile Avoidance</a>, which skips annotation processing if only method bodies are changed in dependencies. Compile Avoidance is possible only when all KAPT dependencies are declared explicitly in annotation processing classpath. To turn off AP discovery in compile path, and therefore turn on Compile Avoidance, add the following option:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kapt.include.compile.classpath=false
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;re considering enabling these options by default in the near future, so we&#8217;d love you to try these in your projects and share with us your feedback!</p>
<p>Note that the minimal supported version of Gradle is now 4.1. For Android Gradle Plugin, it&#8217;s 3.0.</p>
<h2>Standard library: operations for unsigned number arrays</h2>
<p>Starting from Kotlin 1.3 you could use unsigned number types in an experimental mode. This release brings support for more operations for unsigned types and arrays of unsigned types that mirror those for regular number types:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    val u1 = 2_147_483_649u
    val u2 = 4_000_000_000u
    println(u1.toDouble())
    println(minOf(u1, u2))

    val array: UIntArray = uintArrayOf(u1, u2)
    println(array.max())
    println(array.all { it &gt; Int.MAX_VALUE.toUInt() })
}
</pre>
<p>Note that you already could use many functional operations like <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> for unsigned arrays, because arrays of unsigned numbers implement <code>Collection</code>, e.g., <code>UIntArray</code> implements <code>Collection&lt;UInt&gt;</code>. But then it was tied with the performance overhead since the extra object was <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-classes.html#representation">created</a> when <code>UIntArray</code> is passed as an object of <code>Collection&lt;UInt&gt;</code>. Now all the added extension functions take exact unsigned array types as receivers, which eliminates this overhead. You can work with an array of unsigned number types like you work with arrays of regular number types without worrying about the underlying performance.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native</h2>
<p>We are happy to announce that the list of supported Kotlin/Native targets has expanded. This release brings support for Windows 32 bit target (mingw_x86). In addition to that, Windows and macOS users can cross-compile their Kotlin/Native programs to Linux x86-64, arm32, as well as Android and Raspberry PI devices.</p>
<p>From the compiler side we added fixes to an undefined behaviour when computing a remainder of a division by 0, which now throws an exception. Alignment related issues were also fixed for ARM32 and MIPS platforms.</p>
<h3>Kotlin/Native for Apple platforms</h3>
<p>For the Apple platform, we prepared several improvements too. Unhandled exceptions on iOS devices will now be logged to the iOS crash log. Exception backtraces (in debug mode) now contain symbolic information on iOS and macOS.</p>
<p>Static frameworks can be generated too, use the <code>-Xstatic-framework</code> command line parameter or the following Gradle script for a multiplatform project:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {
    macosX64 {
        binaries {
            framework {
                isStatic = true
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Cocoapods</h4>
<p>Experimental integration with <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> is added as a dedicated Gradle plugin. It turns a Kotlin/Native project into a <code>.podfile</code> dependency which can be included into a <code>Podfile</code>. This allows you to have the same experience when importing and building with Xcode, as you would with Swift or Objective-C pods. We&#8217;ve also made it easier to use and import CocoaPods dependencies into Kotlin/Native projects. The plugin does all necessary configuration steps to import a framework into a Kotlin/Native project. Note, that an Xcode project is now required to fetch and build these dependencies.</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// Apply plugins.
plugins {
    id(&quot;org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform&quot;) version &quot;1.3.30&quot;
    /// the new plugin for CocoaPods support
    id(&quot;org.jetbrains.kotlin.native.cocoapods&quot;) version &quot;1.3.30&quot;
}

// CocoaPods requires the podspec to have a version.
version = &quot;1.0&quot;

kotlin {
    cocoapods {
        summary = &quot;a Kotlin/Native module&quot;
        homepage = &quot;homepage&quot;

        pod(&quot;AFNetworking&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 3.2.0&quot;)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>By running <code>./gradlew podspec</code> it generates a <code>.podspec</code> file which can be included into the <code>Podfile</code> file. For importing a pod, you can use the <code>pod()</code> function.</p>
<h3>C interop</h3>
<p>We now support returning structures from callback functions, meaning that <code>staticCFunction</code> now supports <code>CValue&lt;T&gt;</code> return types! For example, you can call a C function, passing a C function pointer to a Kotlin-implemented function that returns struct:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
*typedef struct * { /*... */} result_value;
*void *functionWithCallback(result_value (*fun_pointer)() );
</pre>
<p>In addition to that, the following changes were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>C-99 <code>bool</code> type is now correctly mapped</li>
<li>UTF-32 C-strings are mapped into Kotlin <code>String</code> class</li>
<li>C compiler intrinsics are included into the <code>platform.builtins</code> package</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a> library is no longer used</li>
<li>Clang modules are supported for Objective-C interop</li>
<li>C interop definition files (<code>.def</code>) are supported in the IDE</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kotlin/Native IDE support</h3>
<p>We are happy to announce the results of our ongoing work to support Kotlin/Native in our IDEs.</p>
<p>In addition to IntelliJ IDEA, we will offer a Kotlin/Native plugin for CLion 2019.1, as well as AppCode 2019.1. C interop definition files (<code>.def</code>) will also be supported by all IDEs, albeit we do not currently provide code completion.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/c-interop-def.png" alt="c-interop-def" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7011" /></p>
<p>For CLion and AppCode, we&#8217;ve also added navigation from backtraces to source code as well as improvements in the debugger support.</p>
<h2>IntelliJ IDEA support</h2>
<h3>Debugging Improvements</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re working hard on making debugging coroutines easier. When you debug coroutine code, you now see a separate “Async stack trace” showing the variables stored at the time of suspension. Let&#8217;s look at a small example:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6998" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/debug-coroutines-code.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>When stopping on a breakpoint inside a suspend function or lambda (in this example, at line 13), “Async stack trace” additionally shows you the state of the variables at the last point of suspension (line 12). You can browse the whole stacktrace of suspend functions starting from the last suspension point in the current coroutine (lines 12 and 4) and check the stored values of the variables:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/debug-coroutines.png" alt="" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7001" /></p>
<p>It should help you understand how you got to the current point of execution.</p>
<p>While debugging Kotlin code, you can now choose “Kotlin” mode to observe the values of the variables. After clicking on the Kotlin icon, you see the variables by Kotlin names, not by auxiliary JVM names, as before:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4043" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/variables-mode-frame.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/variables-mode.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/variables-mode-frame.png';" alt="" width="700" /></p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    1.foo()
}

fun Int.foo() {
    with(&quot;ab&quot;) {
        println(this + this@foo)  // breakpoint
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that you can always add missing variables by using watches, and either merge “variables” and “watches” windows as in the screenshot above or keep them separate, as you prefer.</p>
<h3>Interactive mode for scratch files</h3>
<p>As you know, in Kotlin you can perform small experiments with your codebase using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/quick-run.html#using-scratches">scratch files</a>. Now you can use interactive mode which shows you the results on the fly (after a given timeout), without the need to explicitly rerun the script:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4043" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/scratches.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/scratches.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/scratches.png';" alt="" width="700" /></p>
<h3>Other niceties</h3>
<p>Do you check from time to time TODO items list in your project? IntelliJ IDEA now correctly highlights multiline TODO comments and displays them in the list:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/03/multiline-comments.png" alt="" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7010" /></p>
<p>Some useful inspections and quickfixes were added in this release, such as a fix to automatically introduce an import alias for the imported class name, or a warning of using &#8216;forEach&#8217; method from Java 8 interface rather than from the Kotlin standard library.</p>
<h2>Eclipse IDE plugin update</h2>
<p>New 0.8.14 release of the plugin for the Eclipse IDE brings: support for the Kotlin 1.3.30 compiler, numerous bugfixes and improvements in overall stability. This update also introduces experimental support for Gradle projects. You can now import your projects with <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship">Eclipse Buildship</a> and then you can find them in your Eclipse workspace with correct Kotlin plugin configuration.</p>
<p>You can install experimental Gradle integration via the update site: <code>https://dl.bintray.com/jetbrains/kotlin/eclipse-plugin/last/</code>. To do so open <code>Install new software</code> dialog from Eclipse&#8217;s help menu. Then enter update site url and select <code>Kotlin-gradle</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/eclipse-plugin-gradle.png" width="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7091" /></p>
<p>New Gradle integration works in Spring Tool Suite as well. You are no longer forced to use Maven when you want to develop a Spring application in Kotlin.</p>
<h2>Specifying JVM bytecode targets 9 &#8211; 12</h2>
<p>If you run the code under JVM versions 9, 10, 11, or 12, you can now set the corresponding <code>jvmTarget</code>. This setting will affect the version of the generated classfiles, and the resulting bytecode won&#8217;t run on any lower version of JVM. Note that so far newer versions don&#8217;t add any bytecode optimizations or features beyond the ones that exist in lower versions, but that is going to change in the future.</p>
<h2>How to update</h2>
<p>As always, you can <strong>try Kotlin online</strong> at <a href="http://play.kotl.in/">play.kotl.in</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Maven, Gradle and npm</strong>: Use <code>1.3.30</code> as the version number for the compiler and the standard library. See the docs <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>In IntelliJ IDEA</strong> and <strong>Android Studio</strong>: Update the Kotlin plugin to version 1.3.30. Use <em>Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates</em> and click the “Check for updates now” button.</li>
<li><strong>In Eclipse</strong>: Install the plugin using <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/kotlin-plugin-eclipse">Marketplace</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The command-line compiler</strong> can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.3.30">Github release page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, if you run into any problems with the new release, you’re welcome to ask for help on the <a href="https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/">forums</a>, on Slack (get an invite <a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/">here</a>), or to report issues in the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT">issue tracker</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the new and improved <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10619-kotlin-native-for-appcode">Kotlin/Native plugin</a> for AppCode 2019.1! Enjoy working on Kotlin, Swift, and Objective-C projects for macOS and iOS inside the same IDE. New to AppCode? <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/">AppCode</a> is macOS-only IDE from JetBrains designed specifically for iOS/macOS developers. It offers extensive support for Objective-C and Swift.</p>
<p>To try the plugin out open <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/">AppCode 2019.1</a> (EAP or Release), navigate to <em>Preferences | Plugins</em> and type Kotlin/Native in the Marketplace tab search to find and install the <em>Kotlin/Native for AppCode</em> <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10619-kotlin-native-for-appcode">plugin</a></p>
<h2>New Kotlin/Native Projects for iOS</h2>
<p>The Kotlin/Native plugin for AppCode adds support for Kotlin/Native projects written in Gradle. For reusing code between iOS and Kotlin, we set up Kotlin/Native <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/native/mpp-ios-android.html">build</a> to produce a framework which is used in Xcode. AppCode helps to configure an Xcode build for this scenario. We&#8217;ve added items to the New Project wizard to help us get started with a pre-configured project from scratch.</p>
<p><span id="more-7044"></span></p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-new-project-wizaed.png" alt="appcode2019.1-new-project-wizaed" width="70%" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7046" /></p>
<p>The highlighted project template configures everything. It creates and binds Kotlin/Native Gradle project to an iOS Xcode project, so that the Xcode build will call the Kotlin/Native build automatically, with respect to the selected target. The project will then be ready to work in both Xcode (without Kotlin support) and AppCode.</p>
<p>If you already have an existing project, you can add the Kotlin/Native Framework <em>target</em> by opening the Project Settings dialog (⌘;), clicking on the (+) button in the list of targets, and then selecting the <em>Kotlin/Native | Framework</em> option.</p>
<p>Note that you will need to click on the <em>Import Gradle project</em> or <em>Import Changes</em> link in AppCode after the project is opened.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-unlinked-gradle.png" alt="appcode2019.1-unlinked-gradle" width="45%" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7050"/></p>
<p>The Open Gradle Project dialog will be shown. While the output of the compiler does not have any dependencies or virtual machine requirements, the compiler itself and the Gradle build system require the Java 1.8 or 11 runtime. Use the path to it to fill the <em>Gradle JVM</em> field. Check out the <a href="https://jdk.java.net/11">https://jdk.java.net/11</a> or <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">https://adoptopenjdk.net/</a> for the best JRE, OpenJDK, or JDK distribution. By default on macOS, JVMs are installed to the <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines</code> folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-gradle-import.png" alt="appcode2019.1-gradle-import" width="55%" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7048"/></p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native Gradle Projects Support</h2>
<p>Writing Kotlin/Native code for iOS and macOS is now supported in AppCode too for <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html">Kotlin Multiplatform</a> projects. Open your Gradle project from <code>build.gradle</code> or <code>build.gradle.kts</code> files or use the project wizard to create a new one.</p>
<h2>Kotlin Language Support</h2>
<p>Just to remind you, the Kotlin/Native plugin for AppCode includes Kotlin language support, similar to what you have in <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10454-kotlin-native-for-clion">CLion</a> and IntelliJ IDEA. For example, there is code completion and quick doc dialogs for macOS or iOS classes which are also accessible directly from Kotlin/Native</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-completion.png" alt="appcode2019.1-completion" width="80%"class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7047" /><br />
<img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-quickdoc.png" alt="appcode2019.1-quickdoc" width="80%" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7049" /></p>
<p>Debugger support for Kotlin/Native, Swift, and Objective-C code is improved and included for applications running in an emulator, a device, or a macOS host</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/04/appcode2019.1-debugger.png" alt="appcode2019.1-debugger" width="100%" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7075" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is all the functionality that we have to share with you at this time. Give it a try, let us know what you think, and stay tuned for more exciting features to come as we continue our work on Kotlin/Native and multiplatform projects!</p>

<p><span id="more-6878"></span></p>
<h2>Faster Gradle builds by parallelizing tasks</h2>
<p>The Kotlin Gradle plugin can now run tasks in parallel within a project. Parallel execution is supported by using the Gradle Worker API. To make use of this feature, add the following setting to <code>gradle.properties</code> or <code>local.properties</code> file:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin.parallel.tasks.in.project=true
</pre>
<p>This feature is beneficial for projects defining custom source sets, since the compilation of independent source sets can be parallelized. In the case of multiplatform projects, targets for different platforms can also be built in parallel. For Android, the debug and release build types can be compiled in parallel.</p>
<p>We plan to enable the parallel task compilation by default at a later date, so we kindly ask for your feedback. Do let us know if you face any issues.</p>
<h2>Multiplatform projects update</h2>
<p>We continue working on multiplatform projects and improve different aspects based on your feedback.</p>
<h3>Support for Kotlin Gradle DSL</h3>
<p>You can now use Kotlin Gradle DSL to build multiplatform projects:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
plugins {
    kotlin(&quot;multiplatform&quot;) version &quot;1.3.20&quot;
}
...

kotlin {
    ...
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(kotlin(&quot;stdlib-common&quot;))
            }
        }
}
</pre>
<p>You can check many examples in both Groovy and Kotlin in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>DSL improvements</h3>
<p>The DSL to set up a multiplatform project has been greatly improved and simplified. This blog post contains some highlights in comparison to the previous version. We recommend you read <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html">the updated guide</a> for more details and complete samples.</p>
<p>You can now use shorthand for Kotlin dependencies. That is, instead of <code>'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib'</code> you write simply  <code>kotlin('stdlib')</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, supported targets can be specified directly instead of using the <code>fromPreset</code> function:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// prior
kotlin {
    targets {
        fromPreset(presets.jvm, 'jvm')
        fromPreset(presets.js, 'nodeJs') {
            /* additional configuration */
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// currently
kotlin {    
    jvm()
    js('nodeJs') { /* additional configuration */ }

    // get the existing target:
    def theJsTarget = js('nodeJs')
} 
</pre>
<p>Note that if you need it, the previous functionality still exists, using <code>targetFromPreset(...)</code>.</p>
<p>You can also independently configure Kotlin/Native binaries like executable files or native libraries. For instance, you can use this to export symbols of certain dependencies to an Objective-C framework.</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {    
    macosX64 {
        binaries {
            // Produce the framework and export the dependency.
            framework {
                export(project(&quot;:dependency&quot;))
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ve also made <code>kotlinOptions</code> available, allowing for easier compiler configuration</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
compilations.all {
    kotlinOptions {
        freeCompilerArgs = [&quot;-progressive&quot;, &quot;-Xskip-metadata-version-check&quot;]
    }
} 
</pre>
<p>All improvements are available both in Groovy and Kotlin DSL.</p>
<h3>Android Library (AAR) can be a part of a multiplatform library</h3>
<p>You can now publish Android libraries (AAR) as a part of a multiplatform library. This functionality is disabled by default; to enable it, specify the list of the variants that you want to publish in the scope of the Android target:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kotlin {
    android {
      publishLibraryVariants(&quot;release&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>You can read more about publishing libraries in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html#publishing-a-multiplatform-library">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Improvements for inline classes</h2>
<p>Support for inline classes has been significantly improved, and some constraints have been mitigated. For instance, you can now define an inner class inside an inline class. There are also improvements for non-trivial cases, like using inline functions inside inline classes or passing references to inline classes as arguments to inline functions.</p>
<p>You can now also use reflection with inline classes and have access to class literals and <code>javaClass</code> property</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
inline class Duration(val seconds: Int)

fun test(duration: Duration) {
    // the following expressions are translated into class objects for &quot;Duration&quot; class
    Duration::class
    duration::class
    duration.javaClass
    
    assertEquals(duration::class.toString(), &quot;class Duration&quot;)
    assertEquals(Duration::class.simpleName, &quot;Duration&quot;)  
}
</pre>
<p>There&#8217;s also support for <code>call</code> and <code>callBy</code> for functions that have inline class types in their signature. For more information, refer to the corresponding section on the <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/inline-classes.md#reflection">KEEP</a>.</p>
<h2>Kotlin/Native</h2>
<h3>Code contracts</h3>
<p>Some time ago we introduced experimental support for <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew13.html#contracts">contracts</a>, which allows a function to describe its behaviour in a way that the compiler understands. This functionality is now also available in Kotlin/Native.</p>
<h3>Better interop</h3>
<p>Improved interop including support for more C constructions such as <strong>enums with forward declarations</strong>, as well as better error reporting for cases of inheritance in Objective-C.</p>
<h3>Native frameworks from libraries</h3>
<p>With this release, we can now produce Apple frameworks not only from source files but also from Kotlin libraries (i.e. <code>.klib</code> files). This is possible using the <code>-Xexport-library</code> command line option or via <a href="https://github.com/ilmat192/kotlin-native-gradle-samples">Gradle plugins</a></p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Apart from reducing the memory footprint and improving runtime performance, this release also brings compiler optimizations for looping over ranges, making iterations much faster.</p>
<h2>IntelliJ IDEA support</h2>
<p>This release adds new refactorings, inspections, and intentions to the IntelliJ IDEA plugin. We&#8217;ll highlight some of them.</p>
<h3>Template to generate <code>main</code> without parameters</h3>
<p>Since Kotlin 1.3, you can use the <code>main</code> function without parameters. Now, the default &#8216;main&#8217; live template adds this new version of <code>main</code>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4043" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/main-template-1.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/main-template-1.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/main-template-1.png';" alt="" width="700" /></p>
<p>If you need to pass some arguments, use &#8216;maina&#8217; live template.</p>
<h3>Inspections to improve coroutines code</h3>
<p>When working with coroutines, you usually follow certain conventions. For instance, you would add an “Async” suffix to a function returning &#8216;Deferred&#8217;, or define a function either as a <code>suspend</code> one or as an extension to <code>CoroutineScope</code>, but never both at the same time (for more details, check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3agLJQ6vt8">talk</a> from KotlinConf). IntelliJ IDEA is now aware of these conventions and offers intentions to fix potential issues:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4043" src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/add-async-intention-3.png" onmouseover="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/add-async-intention-2.gif';"
onmouseout="this.src='https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2019/01/add-async-intention-3.png';" alt="" width="700" /></p>
<h3>New intention for converting SAM as lambda to an anonymous object</h3>
<p>A new intention allows to convert constructs using lambdas with SAM to anonymous objects. For instance</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
val runnable = Runnable {
    action()
}
</pre>
<p>can now be converted automatically by the IDE to</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
val runnable = object : Runnable {
    override fun run() {
        action()
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>String conversion improvements</h3>
<p>&#8216;Convert concatenation to template&#8217; intention is now smarter, meaning</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
class Card(val suit: Any, val value: Any) {
    override fun toString(): String = value.toString() + suit.toString()
} 
</pre>
<p>will be converted to</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
class Card(val suit: Any, val value: Any) {
    override fun toString(): String = &quot;$value$suit&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>removing the unnecessary <code>.toString()</code> calls on each parameter.</p>
<h2>Kapt improvements</h2>
<p>Using Kapt from the command line has been simplified, allowing for direct use as a separate command line tool as opposed to having to use it via the compiler:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// prior
kotlinc -Xplugin=$KOTLIN_HOME/lib/kotlin-annotation-processing.jar ...

// currently
kapt ...
</pre>
<p>All kapt-related arguments are now passed as top-level arguments instead of using the verbose syntax:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
// prior
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt3:apclasspath=&lt;classpath&gt;

// currently
-Kapt-classpath=&lt;classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note that a new option that shows processor timings (-Kapt-show-processor-timings`) has also been introduced in this release.</p>
<h3>Compile avoidance for kapt</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve added support for <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/3.4/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_compile_avoidance">Compile Avoidance</a> for <code>kaptKotlin</code> tasks in Gradle, improving build performance times. It skips annotation processing completely when there are no changes in kapt stubs and only method bodies are changed in dependencies. Setting</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
kapt.include.compile.classpath=false
</pre>
<p>in <code>gradle.properties</code> enables it. Note, however, that this setting also turns off the AP discovery in compile classpath, but if you add AP to <code>kapt*</code> configuration, that shouldn&#8217;t affect you.</p>
<h2>Other notable mentions</h2>
<p>In addition to the above, a few more fixes and improvements worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incremental compilation for Kotlin/JS is now stable enough and is enabled by default. If you encounter any issues, we&#8217;d appreciate if you <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT">report it to us</a>, and in the meantime, you can disable the option:
<ul>
<li>In a Gradle project, add <code>kotlin.incremental.js=false</code> to <code>gradle.properties</code> or <code>local.properties</code></li>
<li>In an IntelliJ IDEA project, go to <strong>Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Kotlin Compiler | Kotlin to JavaScript</strong> and uncheck <strong>Enable incremental compilation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We now provide a Kotlin BOM (Bill of Materials) file that lists the dependencies used from the <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin</code> group. </li>
<li>Stable sorting is now available on all targets. Previously this was an issue when <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12473">targeting JavaScript</a>.  </li>
<li>Numerous fixes and improvements in scripting support.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-14416">Support for MethodHandle</a> and <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-26165">VarHandle</a> in JVM code generation.</li>
<li>Modularized artifacts for Kotlin JVM libraries are <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-27919">included</a>.</li>
<li>Kotlin/Native will embed <em>bitcode</em> by default for iOS frameworks targets in Gradle projects.</li>
<li>Kotlin/Native annotations <code>@ThreadLocal</code> and <code>@SharedImmutable</code> are now accessible from common code (declared as <code>optional expect</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to update</h2>
<p>To update your IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio plugin, use <em>Tools</em> | <em>Kotlin</em> | <em>Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates</em> and click the “Check for updates now” button. The Eclipse IDE plugin can be installed or updated via the <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/kotlin-plugin-eclipse">Eclipse Marketplace</a> (<em>Help</em> | <em>Eclipse Marketplace</em> and search for the Kotlin plugin).</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to update the compiler and standard library versions in your Maven and Gradle build scripts. As usual, if you run into any problems with the new release, you’re welcome to ask for help on the <a href="https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/">forums</a>, on Slack (get an invite <a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/">here</a>), or to report issues in the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>We previously stated that it is necessary to enable parallel builds in Gradle using</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
org.gradle.parallel=true
</pre>
<p>This is in fact not required, as this would enable cross-project parallelism. Thank you to Cédric Champeau and Eric Wendelin for pointing this out.</p>

This is a guest blog post from <a href="https://github.com/eskatos">Paul Merlin</a><br />
<i>software engineer for Gradle</i>
</div>
<p></center></p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/5.0/release-notes.html">Gradle 5.0</a> includes the <a href="https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/releases/tag/v1.0.2">Gradle Kotlin DSL v1.0</a> which is now ready for widespread use.</p>
<p>We want you to enjoy a build authoring experience with the benefits provided by Kotlin’s static type system in Intellij IDEA and Android Studio: auto-completion, smart content assist, quick access to documentation, navigation to source and context-aware refactoring.</p>
<p><center></p>
<div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br />
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-6822-1" width="640" height="640" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="auto" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://gradle.org/images/hello-kotlin-2.webm?_=1" /><a href="https://gradle.org/images/hello-kotlin-2.webm">https://gradle.org/images/hello-kotlin-2.webm</a></video></div>
<p style="font-size:12px">To view the video in Safari you may need to install the <a style="color:#515151" href="http://get.videolan.org/vlc/3.0.4/macosx/VLC-webplugin-3.0.4.dmg">VLC Web Browser Plugin</a>.</p>
<p></center></p>
<p>In case you missed it, you can watch Paul Merlin demonstrate these benefits in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAtrEPeAJSc">Type-safe build logic with Gradle Kotlin DSL</a> video from KotlinConf 2018.</p>
<p>If you prefer the flexibility and dynamic features of Groovy, that&#8217;s totally okay — the Groovy DSL will not be deprecated.</p>
<h1>Using the Kotlin DSL today</h1>
<p>You can get started quickly by following the <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/">Creating New Gradle Builds</a> guide. You can also follow one of the other guides like <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/building-kotlin-jvm-libraries/">Building Kotlin JVM Libraries</a> or <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/building-java-applications/">Building Java Applications</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html">Gradle Kotlin DSL Primer</a> user manual chapter is the best place to start learning more: it will cover all the basics and answer most of your questions.</p>
<p>If you are working with an existing build using the Gradle Groovy DSL you’ll be interested in the <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-build-logic-from-groovy-to-kotlin/">Migrating build logic from Groovy to Kotlin</a> guide.</p>
<p>Several community plugins now have Gradle Kotlin DSL snippets in their documentation: <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/html/">Spring Boot</a>, <a href="https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://arturbosch.github.io/detekt/kotlindsl.html">Detekt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jeremymailen/kotlinter-gradle">Kotlinter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-apt-plugin">APT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5/#readme">Android JUnit 5</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stoyicker/android-check-2">Android Check 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher">Android Play Publisher</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6790">the list goes on</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/">Gradle documentation</a> contains build script excerpts that demonstrate both the Groovy DSL and the Kotlin DSL. This is the best place to find how to all things with each DSL; and it covers all Gradle features.</p>
<p>Again, a big thank you to all who helped make this a reality!</p>
<h1>Feedback wanted</h1>

<h2>Kotlin Native and Multiplatform Projects</h2>
<p>December 12th, 16.00 &#8211; 17.30 CET</p>
<p><strong>16.00 &#8211; 16.30</strong> Kotlin/Native presentation by Nikolay Igotti</p>
<p>Is Kotlin a JVM-only language? Can I explore and improve Apple or Linux ecosystem using Kotlin and JetBrains’ tools I know and love? How far I can go? We will discuss Kotlin/Native, its features and limitations, the technology behind it, innovative concurrency approach, our mid-term roadmap, and long-term plans.</p>
<p><strong>16.30 &#8211; 16.40</strong> break</p>
<p><strong>16.40 &#8211; 17.25</strong> Kotlin Multiplatform Projects by Nikolay Igotti</p>
<p>Are fully functional mobile applications doomed to be written twice for iOS and Android? Will common porting layer (like in React Native, Flutter) cut off all the cool platform-specific features? Can JetBrains provide us with tools suitable for multiplatform development? We will discuss the philosophy behind Kotlin multiplatform (MPP) technology, supported target platforms and ecosystems, available tools, multiplatform libraries, and how to use Kotlin everywhere you need it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we work on Kotlin, we implement many features that help build idiomatic and high-performing APIs. We&#8217;ve been dreaming of seeing a Web framework that utilizes these features to the max. Today, we can finally say we&#8217;ve built that kind of framework! Please welcome <a href="http://ktor.io/">Ktor</a>, which has just reached 1.0.</p>
<p>Ktor is a Kotlin framework for building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems. It is being created by the Kotlin team, and as such, it takes full advantage of the language in order to provide a great developer experience and excellent runtime performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/kotlin/files/2018/11/Ktor.png" alt="Ktor" width="1600" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6774" /></p>
<p>Ktor is built from the ground up using <strong>coroutines</strong>, which make it possible to express complex asynchronous constructs as if they were simple sequential code. Coroutines are also quite efficient at runtime. In addition, the use of Kotlin features allows us to provide a <strong>domain-specific language (DSL)</strong> — a concise and developer-friendly API for configuring your application with no magic, just code.</p>
<p><span id="more-6762"></span></p>
<p>Of course, Ktor is not the only option for building server-side applications in Kotlin. We&#8217;re pleased to see that other frameworks such as Spring and Vert.x are providing first-class support for Kotlin, and using these frameworks is a great way to preserve your existing investment and experience. At the same time, Ktor offers unique advantages thanks to its use of coroutines and DSLs, which makes it a great option when you&#8217;re starting a new backend project or a microservice.</p>
<p>Ktor is already deployed in production in a number of projects running at scale. For example, <a href="http://hltv.org/">HLTV.org</a> serves about 200 million pageviews per month and about 3.1 billion pageviews in total on Ktor. The latest release of the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a> lists Ktor in their Assess category.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s Included</h1>
<p>The two main parts of Ktor are the <strong>HTTP server framework</strong>, running on the JVM, and the <strong>multiplatform HTTP client</strong>. As a JetBrains project, Ktor naturally comes with helpful <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10823-ktor">tools</a> to get you started with new projects quickly.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The <strong>HTTP server</strong> part is built upon proven technologies like Netty, Jetty, and also Java servlets. When using lightweight engines like Netty or Jetty, it starts ultrafast and is ready to receive connections in under a second. It is compatible with the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factors</a> paradigm, is container-friendly, and can easily be embedded into desktop (or even Android) applications. You can also run it in an application server such as Tomcat.</p>
<p>Ktor provides a rich and easy-to-use extensibility mechanism, on top of which most of the built-in functionality is implemented. Third-party features look no different from the built-in ones. Out of the box, Ktor includes all the essential features like sessions, authentication, JSON serialization, popular template engines, Web sockets, metrics, and many others. It also supports a productive development workflow, with a fast start, automatic reloading, and easy-to-use facilities for writing unit and integration tests.</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The <strong>client</strong> part is asynchronous as well, built using the same coroutines and IO primitives that drive the server. This makes it perfect for building asynchronous microservice architectures, connecting all the backend functionality into asynchronous pipelines.</p>
<p>The client is implemented as a multiplatform library, which currently supports JVM, JS, Android, and iOS. This makes it possible to retrieve data on mobile devices and web pages in a uniform way, without blocking application execution or building complex chains of anonymous functions to handle successes or failures.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Last but not least, the <strong>tools</strong> let you select the features you need and get a fully working starter app with Ktor. This works both <a href="http://start.ktor.io/">on the Web</a> and via a <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10823-ktor">plugin</a> for IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>Like all other Kotlin libraries, Ktor is free and open-source, developed <a href="https://github.com/ktorio/ktor">on GitHub</a> and released under the Apache 2 license.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>The Hello World of Ktor is small enough to fit in a tweet:</p>
<pre class="kotlin-code" data-highlight-only="true" theme="idea" indent="4" style="visibility: hidden; padding: 36px 0;">
fun main() {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        routing {
            get(&quot;/&quot;) {
                call.respondText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
            }
        }
    }.start(wait = true)
}
</pre>
<p>To go beyond that, the website provides a <a href="https://ktor.io/quickstart/index.html">Quickstart guide</a>, extensive documentation for writing <a href="https://ktor.io/servers/index.html">servers</a> and <a href="https://ktor.io/clients/index.html">clients</a>, and many <a href="https://ktor.io/samples/index.html">sample projects</a>. If you prefer videos, Ryan Harter&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLQ176FUIyIUbVvFMqDc2jhxS-t562uytr&amp;v=V4PS3IjIzlw">KotlinConf 2018 talk</a> is a great introduction to using Ktor on the backend.</p>
<p>Hop over to <a href="https://start.ktor.io/">https://start.ktor.io/</a> to get a project template, check out the docs, and your new backend will be up and running in no time! If you need help, the friendly folks on the #ktor channel on <a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin Slack</a> are there for you.</p>
<p>Have a nice Ktor!</p>

<p>Today we are releasing Kotlin 1.3 together with a set of accompanying libraries, build tools, and learning materials!</p>
<p>We develop Kotlin to be a good tool for all application developers, at all scales and on all platforms. In Kotlin 1.3 coroutines graduated to stable, making non-blocking code easy to read and write. Scalability has never been as approachable before! This release also brings Kotlin/Native Beta that compiles Kotlin code directly to native binaries. The multiplatform capabilities of Kotlin now cover all supported platforms so one can share business logic between such components as Android and iOS apps. Servers can share logic with web and mobile clients too, and multiplatform libraries make everyday tasks easily portable.</p>

<h1>Community and Ecosystem</h1>
<p>Kotlin has seen an unprecedented growth in adoption this year. Since January 2018, about 1.5 million users wrote Kotlin code, and this number has more than doubled since last year. The trends on StackOverflow and in our public Slack are also very encouraging. We are grateful to the Kotlin community for being supportive and welcoming!</p>
<p>We are happy to see the ecosystem around Kotlin grow and mature. Kotlin is friends with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kotlin">Google Cloud Platform</a>, the <a href="https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/">Spring Framework</a> and <a href="https://gradle.org/kotlin">Gradle</a>, not to mention the <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/">first-class support on Android</a>. The open source community is creating excellent libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin">RxKotlin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin">mockito-kotlin</a>, <a href="https://tornadofx.io/">TornadoFX</a>, <a href="http://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/">Kodein</a>,  and <a href="https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow">ΛRROW</a>. And projects like <a href="https://github.com/square/okio">Square&#8217;s Okio</a> and <a href="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2018/09/22/libreoffice-at-droidcon-vienna/">LibreOffice</a> are migrating to Kotlin or planning to do so. Everyone is welcome to join the Kotlin ecosystem with their great ideas and projects!</p>
<p>Many people outside JetBrains contributed to Kotlin 1.3 with pull requests, bug reports and all kinds of feedback. We appreciate your help a lot and are really happy to move Kotlin forward together!</p>
<h1>Coroutines are now stable</h1>
<p>Coroutines are a modern way to write non-blocking asynchronous code that&#8217;s easy to understand and evolve. It&#8217;s a powerful tool for anything from offloading work onto background workers to implementing complicated network protocols. The <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines">kotlinx.coroutines</a> library hits 1.0 release and provides a solid foundation for managing asynchronous jobs at any scale including composition, cancelation, exception handling and UI-specific use cases.</p>

<h1>Kotlin/Native Beta</h1>
<p>Kotlin/Native uses <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> to compile Kotlin sources to standalone binaries (no VM required!) for various operating systems and CPU architectures including iOS, Linux, Windows, Mac and even WebAssembly and embedded systems like STM32. It features fully automatic memory management, can interoperate with C, Objective-C (and Swift), and exposes platform APIs such as Core Foundation, POSIX, and any native library you fancy!</p>
<p>The Kotlin/Native runtime promotes immutable data and prohibits any attempts of sharing unprotected mutable state between threads. In fact, threads don&#8217;t exist for Kotlin/Native, they are abstracted away as a low-level implementation detail and replaced by workers — a safe and manageable way of doing concurrency.</p>

<h1>Multiplatform projects and tooling</h1>
<p>Working on all platforms is an explicit goal for Kotlin, but we see it as a premise to a much more important goal: sharing code between platforms. With support for JVM, Android, JavaScript, and Native, Kotlin can handle any and all components of a modern application. And this brings the invaluable benefit of reuse for code and expertise, saving the effort for tasks more challenging than implementing everything twice or multiple times. While multiplatform capabilities in Kotlin are still experimental, 1.3 makes a big step forward.</p>
<p>Kotlin 1.3 ships with a set of multiplatform libraries that cover everyday tasks such as <a href="http://ktor.io/clients/http-client/multiplatform.html">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization">serialization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines">managing coroutines</a>. The easiest way to write multiplatform code is to rely on such libraries. You can also create your own multiplatform libraries wrapping platform-specific dependencies into a common API.</p>

<h1>Tooling for Kotlin/Native and Multiplatform</h1>
<p>Kotlin 1.3 features tooling support for Kotlin/Native and Multiplatform projects that&#8217;s available in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, and Android Studio. All code editing features such as error highlighting, code completion, navigation and refactoring are available in all the three IDEs. We&#8217;ll be working on more advanced features and integrations with commercial tooling.</p>
